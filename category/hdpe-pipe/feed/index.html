										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you previously bought roll pipes? Hope you are happy with the quality because often, customers regret purchasing generic roll pipes and complain about leakages, regular maintenance needs and unreliable performance. So, we advise everyone to make informed decisions. Let us explain what you should know before buying your next roll pipes.</p>
<h6>What is a roll pipe?</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>As you might know, roll pipes are flexible, soft, and organised in coils for easy storage and transportation; primary usage is carrying water, non-corrosive chemicals and oils. You can spot uses of roll pipes in construction, irrigation, temporary water supply, or in municipality tankers distributing drinking water. However, the heat resistance of flexible roll pipes is not significant. So, it is advisable to avoid using roll pipes in high-temperature zones and fire-prone areas. Usually, roll pipes come in two types of materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>PVC</li>
<li>PE</li>
<li>HDPE</li>
</ul>
<p>Polyethylene or PE is combustible as a material and can catch fire. PVC and HDPE or high-density PE materials are fire-retardant. HDPE melts when heated around 125 degrees. So, PE and HDPE roll pipes should not be used in fire extinguishing applications. PVC hose pipes have higher melting points.</p>
<h6>Benefits of roll pipes</h6>
<p></br></p>
<ul>
<li>Roll pipes are easy to store and transport. You can fit these pipes and dismount them quickly without specialised skills and equipment.</li>
<li>The flexibility of roll pipes allows transporting water across uneven terrains like hills, undulating plains, and construction sites.</li>
<li>It is value for money compared to other piping options as roll pipes are cheaper to own and maintain.</li>
<li>Good quality roll pipes can be highly durable and offer long term performance with minimal maintenance.</li>
<li>Roll pipes are available in multiple diameters like 1-inch, 1.5-inch, 2-inch, 3-inch and others for a wide range of water carrying applications.</li>
<li>HDPE and PVC roll pipes are suitable for carrying potable water.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Things to check before buying roll pipes</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>You should be careful about a few things before deciding to buy roll pipes for your specific applications. They are,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Suitability to your application</strong>; the choice of roll pipes should differ with its end applications. For example, you should choose food-grade HDPE pipes to distribute drinking water. You can select regular PE roll pipes for carrying non-food and non-human use fluids.</li>
<li><strong>Look out for manufacturing defects</strong>; roll pipes can get damaged due to improper storage in a store. Check it before purchasing.</li>
<li><strong>Choose branded products</strong>. Reputed brands are well-recognised for product quality, while generic alternatives can be cheaper but unreliable for durability and longevity.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, don’t pick up any roll pipes you come across on a shop rack or just because it is the cheapest. You might need to spend more later. Ori-Plast is a top brand manufacturing high-quality roll pipes for various applications. Check Ori-Plast’s roll pipe 1.5 inch prices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HDPE pipes are the best POLYETHYLENE pipes for outstanding durability and the cleanest water supply. It is a versatile material suitable for various piping applications and one of the most common pipes used in residential and commercial construction projects. You can transport all sorts of fluids through HDPE pipes without worrying about your pipe getting corroded or damaged.</p>
<p>However, not all HDPE pipes are manufactured equal. There are various types of HDPE piping materials, and each one has its own set of specialities. Read on to find out which one is right for your requirements. We&#8217;ll go through some essential things to consider when purchasing HDPE pipes or choosing the right HDPE pipe manufacturers.</p>
<h6><strong>What is HDPE?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>HDPE or High-Density Polyethylene is a strong, durable, and flexible thermoplastic material. Strong molecular bond and impermeability make HDPE pipes leakage-free, a perfect alternative to steel and concrete main pipes carrying fluids and gases. Also, HDPE can be joined following various welding methods like,</p>
<ul>
<li>Butt fusion (the most reliable and easily joinable)</li>
<li>Electrofusion</li>
<li>Extrusion</li>
<li>Socket welding</li>
</ul>
<p>It makes HDPE versatile for various piping applications. You can transport all sorts of fluids through HDPE pipes without worrying about design limitations.</p>
<h6><strong>The Different Types of HDPE Pipes &amp; Fittings </strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>HDPE (high-density Polyethylene) pipes come in different grades, specifications depending on nominal pressure ratings and material quality. Nominal pressure rating indicates the maximum pressure that an HDPE pipe can survive. In terms of material quality, HDPE pipes are usually rated from PE 63 to 100. The higher the PE value, the greater are the Minimum Required Strength, Stress Crack Resistance and Rapid Crack Propagation Resistance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum Required Strength</strong>-It is the characteristic of any material that provides long term strength and resistance to deforming under continuous stress.</li>
<li><strong>Slow Crack Resistance</strong>-Slow crack is a significant challenge and a common failure in an underground piping system built to survive for multiple decades. High PE rated HDPE pipes offer excellent resistance to slow crack for reliable longevity.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid Crack Propagation Resistance</strong> &#8211; It is another critical material property for an underground main piping system. As the name suggests, this material characteristic helps contain any crack and prevent it from spreading linearly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the standard HDPE piping and fittings products are,</p>
<ul>
<li>HDPE pipes</li>
<li>HDPE tee</li>
<li>HDPE fabricated equal tee,</li>
<li>HDPE flange</li>
<li>HDPE long neck pipe end</li>
<li>HDPE end cap</li>
<li>HDPE blind flanges</li>
<li>Bend (Fabricated)</li>
<li>MS Flange</li>
<li>Reducer (Step1)</li>
<li>Reducer (Step2)</li>
<li>Reducer (Step3)</li>
<li>Reducer (Step4)</li>
<li>ZUT PUT Coupling</li>
<li>PE Coupling / Expansion Joint</li>
<li>Handi Band SS Repair Clamp</li>
<li>Finger Repair Clamp</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>Client requirements: HDPE pipes suitable to your Project</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>HDPE pipes offer the best performance and value for money for residential and commercial consumers. Some of the salient consumer benefits of using HDPE in piping systems are,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trenchless installation</strong>-Perfect material for trenchless installation reducing the cost of installation.</li>
<li><strong>Zero-leakage performance</strong>-HDPE offers leakage-free performance, preventing contamination and water flow loss. It saves money.</li>
<li><strong>Jointless construction</strong> &#8211; allows lower lifecycle ownership cost of HDPE piping system due to easy installation of zero chances of leakage from pipe connectors.</li>
<li><strong>Environment friendly</strong> &#8211; HDPE is environment-friendly piping material as it does not allow contamination of water and ground soil. It is also energy efficient due to the ease of installation.</li>
</ul>
<p>When purchasing HDPE piping for any project, you need to ensure that it&#8217;s the correct type of HDPE for your requirements. The usages of HDPE is rapidly increasing, and the major HDPE piping applications are:</p>
<ul>

However, there is considerable debate as to which pipe is the best to work with when it comes to piping solutions for homes and businesses. Both PVC and HDPE pipes have their strengths and weaknesses and it can be hard to choose one.<br />
Here’s a comparison between <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/pvc-pipes/">PVC pipes</a> </strong> and HDPE to help you decide which pipe to work with for your plumbing needs.</p>
<h6><strong>What are PVC and HDPE Pipes?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) and HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) pipes and fittings are extensively used in water piping systems. PVC pipes and HDPE pipes have some common characteristics which make them a preferred choice for a wide array of applications.<br />
Both are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Made of plastic</li>
<li>Lightweight</li>
<li>Resistant to Corrosion</li>
<li>Resistant to bacterial and chemical build-up</li>
<li>Have higher life expectancy than metallic pipes</li>
</ul>
<h6>Differences between PVC pipe fittings and HDPE pipe fittings</h6>
<p></br></p>
<h6>Durability</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC is a durable vinyl polymer whereas HDPE is a polyethylene thermoplastic made from petroleum. Both pipes are strong through high temperatures. When comparing failure ratings when exposed to events like rain, stress, wind, heat or cold, HDPE is proven to be more durable. PVC pipes has a rating of one in 48,650 events; HDPE one in 10,000,000 events.<br />
<strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/pvc-pipes/suppliers/">Flexible PVC pipe</a></strong> however is more valuable for one time<br />
projects.</p>
<h6>Joining</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Gasket or<br />
gluing sealant is used to join PVC pipes. HDPE pipes are joined by heat fusion.<br />
Hence, while <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/pvc-pipes/suppliers/">PVC pipe fittings</a></strong> can<br />
be joined underwater, HDPE cannot.<br />
But HDPE<br />
pipes can withstand and dampen more shock waves compared to PVC.</p>
<h6>Thermal Performance</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Continuous exposure to hot or cold weather results in slow expansion of pipes and fittings. HDPE pipes expand four times more than PVC pipes.</p>
<h6>Installation</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC can be<br />
installed in Open Trench and Drop Burial ways. Installation is easy and quick;<br />
not dependant on weather conditions, and requires no particular machinery.<br />
Overall <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/pvc-pipes/">PVC Pipe price</a></strong> is quite low.</p>
<p>HDPE pipes<br />
can be installed in Open Trench, Drop Burial, Directional Bore, and Horizontal<br />
Bore ways. Trained personnel and energy intensive equipment are needed for<br />
installing HDPE fittings. <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/hdpe-pipes/fittings/">HDPE pipe price</a></strong> can be higher.</p>
<h6>Leakage</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC pipes are stronger and stiffer, so they can be mechanically joined to valves, non-plastic fittings. A major drawback is water leakage through these joints.<br />
The softer and more bendable HDPE pipes provide leak-free joints to prevent water leakage.</p>
<h6>Use in Irrigation</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC pipes are extensively used for irrigation. However, more people prefer HDPE pipes for irrigation systems where digging is hard or impossible. For golf-course irrigation systems, HDPE pipes are best suited.</p>
<h6>Applications</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The most common application of PVC pipesis in water-piping at homes. These are also used for sewers, drains, irrigation and industrial purposes.<br />
HDPE has more expansive uses — for distribution of natural gas, petroleum and chemicals. These are also used in water, sanitary and storm sewer systems.<br />
