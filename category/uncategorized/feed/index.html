										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The world is growing mobile and connected, driving the need for faster wireless data speeds. That, in turn, prompts the need for new and improved telecom infrastructure. That includes next-generation networks (NGNs).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the essential components of NGNs is fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) technology. That uses optical fibers to connect homes and businesses directly to the network. FTTH provides several advantages over traditional copper-based technologies, including higher speed and capacity, lower cost, and improved reliability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To learn more about the future of telecom infrastructure and the role of PE pipes in next-generation networks, read on!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Telecom Infrastructure Trends</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2023, telecoms will continue to evolve to meet the ever-growing demand for data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5G</a> will become the norm, and network speeds will continue to increase.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">New technologies, such as edge computing and SDN, will become more widely adopted. That is because they offer more efficient ways to manage data traffic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The use of AI and machine learning will also become more commonplace in the sector. These technologies will help automate network management tasks. That includes tasks such as detecting and correcting outages and faults. AI can also be used to help improve network performance by constantly monitoring data usage and traffic patterns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As data usage increases, so will the need for more storage and processing power. Cloud-based solutions will become more popular. That is because they deliver a more scalable and cost-effective way to meet these needs. Also, look for more telcos to offer &#8220;as-a-service&#8221; models. That allows businesses to pay for only the storage and processing power they use. Besides, the use of virtualization technologies will continue to grow. That is because they offer a way to increase the sector&#8217;s efficiency.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The role of PE pipes in modern telecom networks</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As network infrastructure continues to evolve, so do the materials and components that make up those networks. Essentially, new advances in polymer engineering are offering notable benefits for the next generation of networks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PE pipes have several advantages over traditional materials like metal or concrete. They are lighter and easier to install. Also, they can be made in various sizes and shapes to suit the specific needs of a given application. PE pipes are also more resistant to corrosion and environmental degradation. Also, they are customizable to have a wide range of physical and chemical properties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All these factors make PE pipes an attractive option for modern networks. As networks become more complex and demanding, the usage of PE pipes will become more widespread.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The benefits of PE Pipes for telecom infrastructure</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next-generation networks must have new and innovative ways to transport data and telecommunications signals. One solution that is becoming increasingly popular is the use of PE pipes. PE pipes offer several advantages over traditional methods of signal transport, including:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong> Increased flexibility</strong> – Polyethylene Pipeare much more flexible than metal pipes. That makes them easier to work with during installation.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="2">
<li><strong> Improved durability</strong> – Polyethylene Pipe are unsusceptible to corrosion and wear. That means they will last longer and need less maintenance in the future. Also, they are resistant to chemical and biological attacks.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="3">
<li><strong> Greater capacity </strong>– PE pipes can carry more data than metal pipes, making them ideal for next-generation networks.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: justify;" start="4">
<li><strong> Cost savings </strong>– PE pipes are less expensive than metal pipes. That makes them a more cost-effective solution for telecoms infrastructure.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Telecom companies are increasingly using PE pipes for their next-generation networks. And the trend will only continue in future.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The challenges of Polyethylene Pipe for telcos</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The use of Polyethylene Pipe in the telecom sector is rapidly growing due to their flexibility, resistance to corrosion, and lower installation costs. However, there are still some challenges associated with their use. One challenge is their susceptibility to damage from rodent burrowing and excavation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another challenge is that Polyethylene Pipe can be difficult to fusion weld as they need protection from adverse weather conditions during installation. That can lead to joint leakage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite these challenges, the use of Polyethylene Pipe in the sector will continue to grow. With new advances in fusion welding technology and the creation of better protection methods for buried PE pipes, the telecom industry will be able to take advantage of the many benefits of PE pipes.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To conclude, the future of telecom infrastructure lies in next-generation networks. These networks will be faster and more reliable and use PE pipes to deliver optimal performance. PE pipes are the best pipes for the sector. That is because they are strong, lightweight, and resistant to corrosion. PE pipes are also easy to install and have a <a href="https://oriplast.com/advantages-of-polyethylene-pipe-in-drainage-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long lifespan many advantages</a> compared to traditional pipes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you planning to cut corners and use cheap quality PVC connectors and fittings in your plumbing project? Better not do it. Compromises on PVC connectors can be devastating. In this article, we have tried to understand the characteristics of effective PVC connectors from the perspective of experienced plumbers and fabricators. You cannot make any mistake with suitable quality connectors and fittings.</p>
<h6><strong>What purpose do pipe connectors serve? </strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>There are different types of pipe and tube connectors, fittings like Collar, Elbow, Gasket, Union,<br />
Reducer, Tee, Nipple, Trap. Each of these fittings serves specific purposes in a plumbing job. Some of the Aren’t we know that very well? Let’s have a look.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pipe connectors and fittings help to adapt to different shapes and sizes of pipings and tubes.</li>
<li>They manipulate water flow (or other fluids) to change direction and distribution through the plumbing system.</li>
<li>In any plumbing work, piping joints and bends withstand a heavy water pressure load; connectors stand up to the pressure and prevent leakages.</li>
<li>Connectors and fittings help to lay pipes in hard to reach places, narrow corners and planes with curvatures where you cannot fit in straight pipes.</li>
<li>Pipe fittings also help distribute and carry pipes’ weight to an extent in a vertical plumbing system.</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>The quality of PVC connectors </strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>In any market, you can find a socket, a ball valve, a 3-way PVC connector or any other fittings of different brands, material qualities, design and finesse. Usually, we often do not spend enough time enquiring about their features and characteristics. The quality of PVC connectors and fittings can make or break your plumbing work. Let’s have a look at the essential qualities of any suitable PVC connector.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Material quality</strong> &#8211; Connectors can be made of various PVC materials like cPVC and uPVC with different strengths, durabilities, and advantages. Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride or cPVC fittings are suitable for both hot and cold water. On the other hand, un-plasticised PVC or uPVC pipes and fittings offer high tensile and impact strength for better longevity.</li>
<li><strong>Pressure and temperature bearing capabilities</strong> &#8211; The connectors and fittings with better pressure and temperature bearing capacity increase plumbing work’s overall longevity across seasons.</li>
<li><strong>Low thermal contraction and expansion</strong> &#8211; PVC connectors should also match the thermal extension and contraction of attached PVC pipes and tubes. Otherwise, piping work receives unnecessary stress due to daily and seasonal variations in temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Fast and easy installation</strong> &#8211; Consistent, reliable design and finishing of pipe connectors are essential, making installation work easier and less labour-intensive. PVC Connectors and fittings with better finishing also require less solvent cement, reducing the project’s total cost.</li>
<li><strong>Low maintenance requirements</strong> &#8211; Your chosen PVC connectors and fittings should not require regular upkeep and maintenance as it inflates the lifetime ownership costs of plumbing work.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With global<br />
warming causing long and unpredictably dry growing seasons, access to water is<br />
a rising problem in some parts of India. Drinking water, irrigation, or<br />
livestock water for animals has become a growing concern. Many farmers and<br />
agriculturalists are reviewing their irrigation systems to protect their crops.<br />
Fortunately, <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/lldpe-water-tank/">LLDPE water tanks</a></strong> can<br />
help you offset such dry spells and benefit irrigation.</p>
<h6><strong>Why Use Water Tank for Irrigation?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Irrigation<br />
tanks have been an age-old tradition in India. Water storage tanks are filled<br />
with natural water resources like rainfall and then stored to be used for<br />
mainly agricultural purposes, and also for domestic and other uses.</p>
<p>As the<br />
country is grappling with ground water depletion and erratic monsoon, tank<br />
water harvesting has become vital for industries like agriculture, food<br />
processing or construction.</p>
<p>As a leading <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/water-tanks/750-litre/">LLDPE water tank<br />
manufacturer</a></strong>, Ori-Plast provides hygienic and durable water storage<br />
solutionsthat help users take advantage of tank water irrigation.</p>
<h6><strong>Benefits of Tank Water Irrigation</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Tank water<br />
irrigation offers a host of benefits including replenishing groundwater levels,<br />
supplying drinking water to rural communities and domestic animals, protecting<br />
top soil and harboring fish. Let’s delve deeper into the benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Groundwater replenishment</strong> Water storage tanks can substantially<br />
replenish groundwater in drought-prone areas which otherwise depend on well<br />
irrigation.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrological balance </strong>By using tank and well irrigation in<br />
conjunction, you can achieve an enhanced hydrological equilibrium</li>
<li><strong>Bumper crop production</strong> Tank irrigation can benefit both<br />
landowners and laborers because farm activities are no longer dependent on<br />
seasonal rainfall; with water available for perennial irrigation, farming<br />
continues all year round, leading to more crop production.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits for small farmers </strong>The benefits of tank irrigation<br />
encourage small farmers to invest more in water storage tanks, due to the<br />
sustainability and high returns they provide.</li>
<li><strong>Other benefits </strong>Tank water also serves other essential<br />
needs like supplying drinking water, livestock rearing and harboring fish.</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>LLDPE Tank or Plastic Water Storage<br />
Tank</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>In recent<br />
years, plastic water tanks are increasingly being used for home use as well as<br />
for irrigation and commercial purposes. Plastic tanks are preferred over cement<br />
tanks or steel tanks because they cost less and are lightweight. Plus, high<br />
quality plastic tanks are non-toxic and do not interfere with the taste and<br />
odor of the water stored in them.</p>
<p>Some tanks<br />
react when exposed continuously to sunlight, but FDA approved polyethylene resins<br />
that constitute plastics, are safe to store food and water.</p>
</p>
<p>Ori-Plast utilizes<br />
latest technological innovations to design the LLDPE water tanks that are made<br />
from Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE).</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/water-tanks/1000-litre/">Ori-Plast water tanks</a> </strong>come in multiple layers with foam<br />
filled between the layers both on inside and outside. The layers prevent heat<br />
transmission, thereby ensuring that the water stored remains cooler than the external<br />
temperature. These tanks boast of excellent storage capacity, hygienic water<br />
storage and cost effectiveness. A preferred choice of users far and wide, LLDPE<br />
water tanks are leak proof and resistant to corrosion and chemicals.</p>

<h6><strong>What are PVC and HDPE Pipes?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) and HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) pipes and fittings are extensively used in water piping systems. PVC pipes and HDPE pipes have some common characteristics which make them a preferred choice for a wide array of applications.<br />
Both are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Made of plastic</li>
<li>Lightweight</li>
<li>Resistant to Corrosion</li>
<li>Resistant to bacterial and chemical build-up</li>
<li>Have higher life expectancy than metallic pipes</li>
</ul>
<h6>Differences between PVC pipe fittings and HDPE pipe fittings</h6>
<p></br></p>
<h6>Durability</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC is a durable vinyl polymer whereas HDPE is a polyethylene thermoplastic made from petroleum. Both pipes are strong through high temperatures. When comparing failure ratings when exposed to events like rain, stress, wind, heat or cold, HDPE is proven to be more durable. PVC pipes has a rating of one in 48,650 events; HDPE one in 10,000,000 events.<br />
<strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/pvc-pipes/suppliers/">Flexible PVC pipe</a></strong> however is more valuable for one time<br />
projects.</p>
<h6>Joining</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Gasket or<br />
gluing sealant is used to join PVC pipes. HDPE pipes are joined by heat fusion.<br />
Hence, while <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/pvc-pipes/suppliers/">PVC pipe fittings</a></strong> can<br />
be joined underwater, HDPE cannot.<br />
But HDPE<br />
pipes can withstand and dampen more shock waves compared to PVC.</p>
<h6>Thermal Performance</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Continuous exposure to hot or cold weather results in slow expansion of pipes and fittings. HDPE pipes expand four times more than PVC pipes.</p>
<h6>Installation</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC can be<br />
installed in Open Trench and Drop Burial ways. Installation is easy and quick;<br />
not dependant on weather conditions, and requires no particular machinery.<br />
Overall <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/pvc-pipes/">PVC Pipe price</a></strong> is quite low.</p>
<p>HDPE pipes<br />
can be installed in Open Trench, Drop Burial, Directional Bore, and Horizontal<br />
Bore ways. Trained personnel and energy intensive equipment are needed for<br />
installing HDPE fittings. <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/hdpe-pipes/fittings/">HDPE pipe price</a></strong> can be higher.</p>
<h6>Leakage</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC pipes are stronger and stiffer, so they can be mechanically joined to valves, non-plastic fittings. A major drawback is water leakage through these joints.<br />
The softer and more bendable HDPE pipes provide leak-free joints to prevent water leakage.</p>
<h6>Use in Irrigation</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC pipes are extensively used for irrigation. However, more people prefer HDPE pipes for irrigation systems where digging is hard or impossible. For golf-course irrigation systems, HDPE pipes are best suited.</p>
<h6>Applications</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The most common application of PVC pipesis in water-piping at homes. These are also used for sewers, drains, irrigation and industrial purposes.<br />
HDPE has more expansive uses — for distribution of natural gas, petroleum and chemicals. These are also used in water, sanitary and storm sewer systems.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you are upgrading your plumbing system or planning the next plumbing project, it’s important to choose the right type of pipe for the job. It is becoming more common to replace metal water pipes by polymer pipes due to the many advantages of plastic over metal. Let us find out what makes Polymer pipes, more commonly known as PVC pipes,stronger and more popular than metal pipes.</p>
<p><a href="https://oriplast.com/polymer-bath-fittings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polymer pipes</a> are most commonly made of Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which is a combination of plastic and vinyl. There are also CPVC (chlorinatedpolyvinyl chloride) piping, PERT (polyethylene-raised temperature) and others to choose from. The safety, durability, cost efficiency and recyclability of polymer piping have made it a preferred choice for various piping applications ranging from drinking water transportation, to drainage systems to fire sprinkler solutions.</p>
<h6><strong>Advantages of Using Plastic Pipes over Metals Pipes</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The word “plastic” mean pliable, or something that can be easily shaped. This property of plastics and numerous other features make it a valuable raw material for the piping industry.</p>
<h6><strong>Safety</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Polymer pipes are a safe choice for transporting clean, healthy drinking water. These pipes offer high degree of inertness and resistance to corrosion, which makes them free from bio-film contamination that leads to bacterial growth.</p>
<p>Besides, there are risks like accidents and injuries involved in manufacturing metal parts. Plastic, being comparatively softer and smoother, is safer and easily moldable.</p>
<h6><strong>Durability</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The expected lifespan of an underground polymer pipe can extend over 100 years. One of the main reasons for such longer life is the ability of plastics to withstand physical, chemical, environmental and weather attacks. Metals, on the other hand, are highly prone to chemical and weather attacks –one of the key reasons why plastic pipes are preferred over metal pipes.</p>
<h6><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC pipes are the most cost effective choices compared to other piping materials. The cost to purchase, install, maintain and operate is significantly lower than metals. Home owners and industries can safely choose plastic pipes for their piping needs.</p>
<h6><strong>Lightweight</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Plastic pipes are much more light weight than their metal counterparts, weighing ten times less than steel. Reducing part weight is one the major concerns of any industry. Replacing heavy metal pipes can be a major, expensive operation.</p>
<h6><strong>Environment Friendly</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Since polymer is a low carbon plastic, PVC have definite environmental advantages over other materials. Polymer pipes are more efficient to manufacture in terms of energy consumption, and are non toxic, which helps the environment.</p>
<p>Metal pipes are susceptible to leakage, which leads to water loss and ultimately higher water bills. Plastic water pipes can help conserve water through reduced leakage.</p>
<h6><strong>Recyclability</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The biggest advantage of plastic over metals is that plastic can be recycled. Polymer pipes can be melted and reused several times, while metal pipes once damaged must be discarded and replaced.</p>
<h6><strong>Faster Manufacturing</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Plastics can be easily manufactured in comparison to metals. Shorter production cycle contributes to higher cost efficiency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adequate water supply is crucial for agriculture. It affects crop yield and plays a vital role in food security. In India, approximately 48.8% of about 140 million hectares of agricultural land is irrigated, which contributes towards 80% of the groundwater consumption in the country. The remaining land relies on the seasonal monsoon for irrigation. Given this scenario, irrigation must be done keeping two goals in mind — reducing water consumption and increasing productivity.</p>
<p>Several advanced irrigation techniques like the sprinkler system, drip mechanism, micro-irrigation, water harvesting, and recycling, etc., are deployed these days to minimize water wastage. Agricultural pipes supplement these techniques, making more effective and greener irrigation possible.</p>
<h6><strong>What are Agricultural Pipes?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Agricultural pipes connect the water source to the field, facilitating the flow of water, fertilizers, and other nutrients to the plants, as per the irrigation method.</p>
<p>The agricultural pipes, made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), are 100% recyclable and environment-friendly. Before the advent of PVC pipes, farmers were dependent on cast iron or galvanized steel pipes, which were not only expensive but also bulky and susceptible to rusting and chemical decomposition.</p>
<p>PVC pipes have transformed the sector, enabling farmers to irrigate large areas of land and transport water over long distances easily, quickly, and economically.</p>
<p>So what are the features of PVC pipes that make them the perfect choice for agriculturists?</p>
<ul>
<li>They are lightweight, tough, and durable.</li>
<li>They resist weathering, corrosion, abrasion, and leaks.</li>
<li>Their long life span and minimal maintenance requirement makes them cost-effective</li>
<li>The unplasticized version of PVC allows it to carry water smoothly with minimal turbulence.</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>Responsible and Green Irrigation with Agricultural Pipes</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>As a result of the production process they go through, agricultural pipes and the unique features they offer green solutions to several of our conservation concerns.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some of the eco-friendly benefits of PVC <a href="https://oriplast.com/agricultural-pipes-fittings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agriculture pipes</a>.</p>
<h6><strong>Smaller carbon footprint</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The manufacturing of PVC agricultural pipes consumes less energy and creates minimal waste. These pipes are fully recyclable, therefore, have a smaller carbon footprint. Moreover, their production involves the use of chlorine, which is an abundantly available natural resource.</p>
<h6><strong>Less wastage of water</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The leak-free fitting of PVC pipes is one of the biggest pluses for agricultural applications as they curb percolation and seepage. An agricultural pipe network is pressure-regulated and helps to minimize tail-end water losses.</p>
<h6><strong>No water logging and resultant issues</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>No leakage means there are no water-logging issues. Thanks to this, farmers can control the problems arising out of water logging, such as the unnecessary growth of weeds and pests along the irrigation channel, to a large extent.</p>
<p>A well-laid network of agricultural pipes, working as a channel for water conveyance, reduces soil erosion and enhances the accessibility of water to even higher field levels, ensuring uniform distribution throughout.</p>
<p>Besides the above benefits, PVC pipes offer higher economic benefits to the farmers who use them, further incentivizing their use.</p>
<p>These pipes have a super-smooth surface which considerably reduces pumping cost. Also, being lightweight, PVC pipes are easy to handle and require minimal installation cost. The durability of these pipes adds to the cost-advantage ratio.</p>
<p>PVC agricultural pipes, with their ability to meet constant water supply needs, can resolve the irrigation woes of modern farmers, while helping them take greener measures at increased profits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mr. Kumar is making his dream home. Being very particular about each and every minute detail of the construction, he is choosing the best materials for making the house. He is comparing between products and brands and then making the contractor get the same product. But, when it came to SWR pipe and <a href="https://oriplast.com/swr-pipes-fittings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SWR fittings</a> for sewage, rainwater, and waste management, he was a bit confused between G.I. pipe and PVC pipe. The contractor suggested him to get G.I. SWR pipes, but he was not convinced. Though he was more inclined towards buying PVC SWR pipes, he decided to consult an expert, before making any final buying decision.</p>
<p>After meeting the expert, Mr. Kumar got to know that though his thought of choosing PVC <a href="https://oriplast.com/swr-pipes-fittings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SWR pipe and fittings</a> over G.I. pipes was good, there is a material that is even better than PVC, i.e., uPVC. The expert explained to him that, though for a layman, it is tough to differentiate between PVC and uPVC, but in easy terms, PVC contains plasticizers such as BPA and phthalates and these make them more bendable, whereas, uPVC is free of these plasticizers, hence, it assumes a hard texture like cast-iron pipes. Therefore, he stated, uPVC pipes and fittings are better options for SWR management.</p>
<p>He also explained the benefits of using uPVC SWR pipes and fittings.</p>
<h6><strong>Strong</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>SWR pipes are installed outside a building and are exposed to nature. So, SWR pipes must be strong. uPVC is a tough material and thus assures this strength to SWR pipes. They are leakproof and scratch-proof.</p>
<h6><strong>Durable</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>SWR pipes must be durable, as, on average, a building stands along for at least 50 years. After all, you don’t want to reinstall your house’s SWR pipes frequently. The life span of a uPVC pipe is 50 years with zero to minimal maintenance.</p>
<h6><strong>Lightweight</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of uPVC pipes is, they are lightweight, and hence, transportation and installation are easier and cheaper, in comparison to G.I. pipes.</p>
<h6><strong>Corrosion &amp; chemical resistant</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>uPVC SWR pipes are corrosion resistant and chemical resistant. This is a big advantage, as <a href="https://oriplast.com/swr-pipes-fittings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SWR pipes</a> are exposed to rainwater, dust, and domestic chemicals. These characteristics ensure longevity.</p>
<h6><strong>Hot &amp; cold water channeling</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>uPVC pipes can channel both hot and cold water and can bear a temperature of up to 60 ° C.</p>
<h6><strong>Fire resistant</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>uPVC pipes are non-flammable and don’t continue to burn without an external source of ignition.</p>
<h6><strong>Cost-effective</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>SWR pipes are cost-effective as the pipes ensure lower installation, maintenance, and capital costs when compared to other piping systems. The lightweight pipes are easy to install, which in turn reduces installation, handling, and transportation costs. The durability of the SWR pipes also ensures efficiency, thereby making it economical over other materials.</p>
<p>The expert suggested Mr. Gupta to use Ori-Plast’s SWR pipes and fittings, as they are IS 13592:1992 and IS 15328 certified. These are the highest national standards. Ori-Plast is one of the largest uPVC SWR pipes and fittings manufacturers of India, and their products can be trusted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mr. Sharma is a passionate gardener. From the plantation to watering and fertilization, he does everything with his own hands. For him, his fruits and flower plants are like his children and he never compromises with gardening. For decades, he himself sprinkled water and fertilizers on his plants. But with his growing age, it is becoming difficult for him to do it all alone, as the area of his garden is pretty large. So, he is planning to install a drip irrigation system in his garden. But, before taking any final call, he decided to consult an expert about the benefits of using a drip irrigation system in his garden.</p>
<p>The expert suggested to Mr. Sharma that, installing drip irrigation pipes and <a href="https://oriplast.com/drip-irrigation-pipes-fittings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drip fittings </a>will be perfect for his garden. He also explained the benefits of using drip irrigation systems.</p>
<h6><strong>Saves water</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Drip irrigation saves water by directly targeting the root of a plant. It avoids watering those parts of the plant which are not beneficial.</p>
<h6><strong>Keeps the leaves dry</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>As it solely targets the root of a plant, it keeps the leaves dry. Wet leaves can keep spots and cause discolouring. Dry leaves also help to prevent fungus.</p>
<h6><strong>Reduces weed</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>As the areas in between the plants don’t receive water, weed doesn’t grow.</p>
<h6><strong>Avoids soil erosion</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>As drip irrigation involves steady drop by drop dripping of water, it avoids soil erosion caused by the high pressure of water.</p>
<h6><strong>Minimized nutrient runoff</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>When a large volume of water runs off the soil surface, it depletes nutrients in that soil. Since drip irrigation reduces runoff, it reduces the loss of nutrients.</p>
<h6><strong>Fertilization through a drip irrigation system</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Fertilizer injectors can be installed in a drip irrigation system to fertilize plants while watering them. It allows the right amount of fertilizer to drip at the right time. It is a convenient way of fertilization, as it saves fertilizers.</p>
<h6><strong>Reduces energy consumption</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>As a drip irrigation system works at low pressure, pumps consume less energy to release water. Thus, it helps in saving power and reduces the consumption of fuels that are required to create that energy.</p>
<h6><strong>Eco-friendly</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>As a drip irrigation system saves water and reduces energy consumption, it can be said that they are eco-friendly.</p>
<h6><strong>Cost-effective</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>A drip irrigation system is cost-effective, as it reduces the involvement of manpower, thus reduces labour cost. It saves water, energy, fertilizer, and also promotes better plant growth. It can also safely use recycled potable water.</p>
<p>Of all the <a href="https://oriplast.com/drip-irrigation-pipes-fittings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drip irrigation fittings manufacturers</a> in India, the expert advised Mr. Sharma to use drip irrigation pipes, fittings, and sprinklers manufactured by Ori-Plast. He said that all their products adhere to the standard of IS 13488. They have a complete range of products that includes, drip irrigation pipe class I, drip irrigation pipe class II, PVC ball valve/control valve, PP drip ball valve/control valve (plain &amp; threaded), flash valve, screen filter, sand/media filter, hydro cyclone filter, ventury assembly, ventury manifold/header assembly, etc. He also suggested Mr. Sharma to check the <a href="https://oriplast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Drip-Irrigation-Brochure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drip irrigation fittings catalogue</a> of Ori-Plast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Borewell and Column pipes are connected to the submersible pump for extracting groundwater. Usually, bore wells are 100ft to 1500ft deep. In order to efficiently handle the sudden rotational torque force that is generated while turning the submersible pump on or off, the pipe should be strong and durable. While traditionally, galvanized iron or G.I. pipes were used in bore wells, the advent of technology has introduced uPVC pipes in the construction of bore wells and tube wells. uPVC pipes being corrosion-resistant, resilient, and economical, have successfully replaced its G.I. precursor.</p>
<p>Ori-Plast, being one of the leading PVC pipe manufacturers in India, has introduced its range of best in quality uPVC <a href="https://oriplast.com/borewell-column-pipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borewell pipes</a> and casing pipes. The range includes Shallow Casing (CS), Medium Casing (CM), Deep Casing (CD), Screen Ribbed pipes, Column Pipe Standard, Column Pipe Medium &amp; Column Pipe Heavy. Casing pipes are manufactured as per BIS 12818 standard and have the ISI mark printed on them.</p>
