										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Bathroom fixtures are an essential part of your home’s design and can make or break a space.<br />
When you have the right combination of style, function, and aesthetics, time in the bathroom will<br />
feel like a retreat. But if you don’t have the right fittings and fixtures to complete the look, then it<br />
may not. A chrome-plated bath fitting can dress up any bathroom with its understated beauty.<br />
The material is also durable enough to stand up against constant exposure to moisture and<br />
soap scum. In short, chrome-plated bath fitting is worth investing in. But how would you choose<br />
the best quality <a href="https://oriplast.com/bath-fittings/chromium-plated/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color:#4B4B56;">CP bath fittings</a> without compromising aesthetics and value for money? This<br />
article answers.</p>
<h3 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">What is Chrome Plating?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chrome plating involves electroplating on any material with a thin layer of chromium. However,<br />
PVC polymers do not react to electroplating, so PVC core fittings are first dipped in chrome<br />
sulfur or palladium chloride bath. It etches the initial metal layer. Then, the polymer core object<br />
is electroplated. The bright finish of chrome makes any thing a better polished and modern look<br />
and feel and offers protection against elements. It is especially applicable to bath fittings and<br />
fixtures. Ori-Plast is one of the top brands in India with chrome-plates bath fittings and fixtures.</p>
<h3 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">Benefits of a Chrome-Plated bath fitting:</h3>
<ul>
<ol><b>Durable &#8211;</b> Chrome-plated bath fittings are durable and can withstand exposure to<br />
moisture and soap scum. It will remain clean and beautiful for many years.</ol>
<ol><b>Easy to Clean &#8211;</b> Unlike other finishes on the market, chrome-plated PVC is easy to clean.<br />
You won’t need to waste much time to get it to look brand new again.</ol>
<ol><b>Lightweight &#8211;</b> Chrome-plated PVC fittings are lightweight, making them easy to move and<br />
install.</ol>
<ol><b>Beautiful Finish &#8211;</b> Chrome plating won’t chip or fade over time as many other finishes do.<br />
It means you don’t have to worry about replacing fittings soon.</ol>
</ul>
<h3 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">Choosing a Chrome-Plated Bath Fitting</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before you head out to the store or order online, it’s crucial to know how to choose the right<br />
quality <a href="https://oriplast.com/bath-fittings/chromium-plated/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color:#4B4B56;">CP bath fittings</a>. Here are some of the factors that you should consider.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Style &#8211;</b> Not all chrome-plated fittings are made the same. Some are of a classical style,<br />
while others are modern and neo-modern. If you want your bathroom to stand out, you<br />
must pay close attention to which style of fitting you choose. Top brands offer CP bath<br />
fittings in different style categories. Take the example of Ori-Plast CP bath fittings; we<br />
offer CP fittings in styles like PLUSH, NEO, GALAXY and CHROMA. Each of these<br />
categories has a different appeal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Installation &#8211;</b> CP bath fittings are luxury products. Top brands like Ori-Plast offer the<br />
highest quality fit and finish; however, you must also be careful while installing these<br />
fittings. Hire only skilled experts to install these fittings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Cost &#8211;</b> Chrome-plated bathroom fittings from top brands are expensive compared to<br />
regular fittings, but that does not mean you have to compromise on value for money.<br />
Check Ori-Plast’s range of competitively priced <a href="https://oriplast.com/bath-fittings/chromium-plated/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color:#4B4B56;">CP bath fittings</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No other material is as common as PVC today when it comes to home, commercial, industrial, and agricultural plumbing. Polyvinyl chloride is an excellent choice for fluid transfer applications like sewage, hot water, municipal main water supply and industrial chemicals. PVC drain pipes are one of such applications; they are used to channel and transfer clogged water, floodwater, and sewage away from one part of your plumbing system to another or out of your premises.</p>
<h6><strong>Where do we use drain pipes?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a common question for many homeowners, and it&#8217;s also a question with a simple answer. Almost everywhere! You can choose from a variety of locations for installing drain pipes. In a house, this can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outside the house &#8211; home sewer, rainwater pipes</li>
<li>Under your yard, in the ground &#8211; bathroom and kitchen drainage, garden drainage</li>
<li>Inside your home, through the walls of your home &#8211; washbasin and kitchen sink drainage</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the standard drainage systems are,</p>
<ul>
<li>Surface Drainage &#8211; for the removal of surface-flowing water using the natural inclination of the land.</li>
<li>Subsurface Drainage &#8211; for the removal of extra water infiltrating into the soil beyond the earth&#8217;s water-holding (capillary) capacity.</li>
<li>Slope Drainage &#8211; for preventing soil erosion, caving in and collapse of a land&#8217;s natural inclination, especially in mountainous regions.</li>
<li>Downspout and Gutter &#8211; For removing rainwater and preventing water clogging on roofs or similar confined spaces.</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>Benefits of using PVC drain pipes and drain fittings</strong></h6>
<ul>
<li>Chemical resistance &#8211; Drain pipes often carry wastewater containing harsh chemicals, bio-residue and other corrosive industrial wastes. Materials suitable for drain pipes should not be chemically reactive to wastewater, and industrial effluents, as that may reduce drain pipes&#8217; operational capabilities and longevity. You might need to spend money on regular maintenance and replacement of pipes and fittings. PVC drain pipes and drain fittings are resistant to chemicals and do not corrode from exposure to harsh industrial wastes. PVC serves the purpose perfectly well.</li>
<li>No rust, no corrosion &#8211; Traditionally, drainpipes and drainage fittings are made of metal alternatives like cash iron. Despite using protective coating, metal pipes are susceptible to decay and rust over time. PVC as a material is entirely free from similar risks.</li>
<li>Strong, durable, lightweight &#8211; Compared to metal and concrete based alternatives, PVC drainage pipes are very lightweight. However, that does not make PVC drain pipes less strong or durable. Polyvinylchloride shows high tensile strength, pressure resistance and survives high-temperature fluctuations offering better durability. Lightweight makes these PVC pipes cheaper to transport, easy to handle and install.</li>
<li>Environment friendly &#8211; Because of low carbon content and less energy-intensive manufacturing, PVC pipes and fittings are environment friendly compared to drain pipes made of metal alternatives. It is a greener choice.</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>How to choose the right location for installing drain pipes?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Expert plumbing contractors and plumbing engineers know it very well. But let&#8217;s have a quick roundup of the central questions to consider before installing your PVC drainage system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where do you want to install the drain pipes? Inside the walls, outside the walls, or under the yard?</li>
<li>What are the sizes of the drain pipes you want to use? Branded PVC drain pipe companies like Ori-Plast have products in all standard and non-standard sizes like 4 inch PVC drain pipe, 3 inch PVC drain pipe and 6 inch PVC drain pipe.</li>
<li>What is the length of the drain pipes you want to use? The standard pipe lengths are 3, 5 and 6 metres.</li>
<li>What type of fluid do you want to transfer, or which kind of clog do you want to avoid? In residential houses, hair, soap, kitchen grease and food residue can clog the drainage system. So, choose the right size of pipes and fittings for easy drainage.</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>Ori-Plast PVC drainage pipes and fittings &#8211; the intelligent choice</strong></h6>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you planning to upgrade your outdated private living space and create a modern feel? It can be the perfect time for a bathroom makeover as it is a great way to take your home from looking old to feeling new and elegant. Get your home in top shape; read ahead for SEVEN tips to refurbish your bathroom!</p>
<h6><strong>Things to remember before a bathroom makeover</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<ul>
<li>1. Set a budget</li>
<li>2. Call in professionals</li>
<li>3. Clean out the clutter</li>
<li>4. Finalise a layout design</li>
<li>5. Decide on the colours</li>
<li>6. Shop bathroom fittings &amp; fixtures</li>
<li>7. Add plants and decorative arts</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>Set a budget</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Budgeting makes things easier to implement; otherwise, it can be tempting to go all-out with a lavish remodel and fall short of cash for other essential liabilities. So, are you planning a minor fixing, tweaking or complete renovation? We do not have the luxury of enormous bathroom spaces; a complete overhaul can indeed open up options to better manage space and give your bathroom a premium feel. But it would require more money, time and personal involvement. Besides, you need to provide cash for the unforeseeable expenses that often come with breaking apart an existing setup. Comparatively, replacing old bathroom fittings with premium-quality PVC bath fittings and fixtures can be a lot less expensive and modern looking. Top Indian PVC bathroom fittings manufacturers like Ori-Plast offers premium Polymer bath fittings in a wide range of colours and designs.</p>
<h6><strong>Call in professionals</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Unless you have expert-level plumbing skills and are fond of doing it yourself, take the help of professionals. There&#8217;s nothing more frustrating than wasting your money on shoddy plumbing jobs. An expert plumbing professional can understand your needs and deliver what is needed to make your bathroom genuinely fabulous. They can also honestly guide you to avoid spending money on unrealistic expectations. It ultimately saves time, effort and cash.</p>
<h6><strong>Clean out the clutter</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>There is so much to do when making your bathroom a better place to spend time. The choice of materials, lighting, tiles, bathroom fixtures, fittings and decorative arts are endless. However, the best advice to remodel and makeover your bathroom is to clean the clutter. Many of us live in ancestral houses and apartments with bathrooms built decades back. Family and personal priorities were different earlier; people used to look at bathrooms from a utilitarian perspective. Things have changed now. So, remove unnecessary space utilisations and streamline the layout if you plan to give your bathroom a private and premium look. Get rid of fixtures that are not needed now and are simply taking up space–you can always buy them later.</p>
<h6><strong>Finalise a layout design</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>If you are overhauling your old bathroom, professional plumbers will always advise finalising a layout before estimating their material and labour. It would help to avoid misunderstand and revise your budget if necessary. A proper remodelling layout would help you get the correct measurement of pipes, fittings, tiles and other materials, minimising the chances of wastage. Sitting with your design plans and figuring out where you want to begin is the best way to determine and fine-tune your budget.</p>
<h6><strong>Decide on the colours</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Gone are the days when bathrooms meant dark coloured paints and minimum lightings. Today, people love painting bathroom walls in their favourite shades and use bathroom fittings and fixtures in matching colours. Premium-quality PVC bathroom fittings offer an excellent range of colour choices. You can check Ori-Plast bathroom PVC fittings.</p>
<h6><strong>Shop bathroom fittings &amp; fixtures</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Often we ask plumbing contractors to purchase materials. But for remodelling and giving your bathroom a premium look, you should take part in shopping bathroom fittings and fixtures. Top Indian PVC bathroom fittings manufacturers today offer a wide range of modern materials, designs and functionalities to choose from; take the example of PTMT SYMET (Polytetra Methylene Terephthalate). Premium PTMT taps and bath fittings are better alternatives to conventional metal options. You can also call top manufacturers like Ori-Plast to learn more about the latest products and prices.</p>
<h6><strong>Add plants and decorative arts</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>No one said that you can have indoor plants only on balconies and drawing rooms! Bathrooms can be a perfect space to add plants, especially those requiring less or no direct sunlight. Living plants can make ambient fresh, uplift mood and give a distinct feel to your private space. Other than green plants, you can also choose decorative arts like painting and small sculptures for your bathrooms. However, try to avoid decorations that are not suitable for naturally humid places like bathrooms.</p>
<p>So, let’s not wait any more and start remodelling your bathrooms. Ori-Plast can offer the best value for the money you are willing to spend on bathroom PVC pipe fittings and fixtures. Call us to learn about our latest range of PVC bath fittings and prices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you are upgrading your plumbing system or planning the next plumbing project, it’s important to choose the right type of pipe for the job. It is becoming more common to replace metal water pipes by polymer pipes due to the many advantages of plastic over metal. Let us find out what makes Polymer pipes, more commonly known as PVC pipes,stronger and more popular than metal pipes.</p>
<p><a href="https://oriplast.com/polymer-bath-fittings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polymer pipes</a> are most commonly made of Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which is a combination of plastic and vinyl. There are also CPVC (chlorinatedpolyvinyl chloride) piping, PERT (polyethylene-raised temperature) and others to choose from. The safety, durability, cost efficiency and recyclability of polymer piping have made it a preferred choice for various piping applications ranging from drinking water transportation, to drainage systems to fire sprinkler solutions.</p>
<h6><strong>Advantages of Using Plastic Pipes over Metals Pipes</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The word “plastic” mean pliable, or something that can be easily shaped. This property of plastics and numerous other features make it a valuable raw material for the piping industry.</p>
<h6><strong>Safety</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Polymer pipes are a safe choice for transporting clean, healthy drinking water. These pipes offer high degree of inertness and resistance to corrosion, which makes them free from bio-film contamination that leads to bacterial growth.</p>
<p>Besides, there are risks like accidents and injuries involved in manufacturing metal parts. Plastic, being comparatively softer and smoother, is safer and easily moldable.</p>
<h6><strong>Durability</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The expected lifespan of an underground polymer pipe can extend over 100 years. One of the main reasons for such longer life is the ability of plastics to withstand physical, chemical, environmental and weather attacks. Metals, on the other hand, are highly prone to chemical and weather attacks –one of the key reasons why plastic pipes are preferred over metal pipes.</p>
<h6><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC pipes are the most cost effective choices compared to other piping materials. The cost to purchase, install, maintain and operate is significantly lower than metals. Home owners and industries can safely choose plastic pipes for their piping needs.</p>
<h6><strong>Lightweight</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Plastic pipes are much more light weight than their metal counterparts, weighing ten times less than steel. Reducing part weight is one the major concerns of any industry. Replacing heavy metal pipes can be a major, expensive operation.</p>
<h6><strong>Environment Friendly</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Since polymer is a low carbon plastic, PVC have definite environmental advantages over other materials. Polymer pipes are more efficient to manufacture in terms of energy consumption, and are non toxic, which helps the environment.</p>
<p>Metal pipes are susceptible to leakage, which leads to water loss and ultimately higher water bills. Plastic water pipes can help conserve water through reduced leakage.</p>
<h6><strong>Recyclability</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The biggest advantage of plastic over metals is that plastic can be recycled. Polymer pipes can be melted and reused several times, while metal pipes once damaged must be discarded and replaced.</p>
<h6><strong>Faster Manufacturing</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Plastics can be easily manufactured in comparison to metals. Shorter production cycle contributes to higher cost efficiency.</p>
