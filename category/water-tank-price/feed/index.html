										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a constant demand for drinking water in our households, be it in cities or villages. We<br />
cannot rely on municipal supply for round-the-clock supply; it requires installing underground<br />
water storage tanks to reserve excess water. The size varies from as low as a few hundred litres<br />
to as big as thousands of gallons. Most of these tanks are constructed by digging a pit closer to<br />
a building and installing prefab PVC underground water tanks. But which should be the correct<br />
location for installing underground water tanks? There is a scientific way to decide it. Read on to<br />
learn more about where to place your underground water storage tank.</p>
<p>Many of us have already learned about Vastu guidelines on architecture and civil construction of<br />
residential, commercial and industrial buildings. But it is an ancient repository of knowledge<br />
based on certain presumptions. What does today&#8217;s science tell us about choosing an<br />
underground water tank location? Let&#8217;s have a look.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">What is the size of the tank?</h4>
<p>The first and foremost consideration is the size of the water tank you need. Everything depends<br />
on it. Usually, a residential underground water tank serving a small family household requires<br />
storing at least 1000 to 3000 litres of water. A standard Ori-Plast underground PVC water<br />
storage tank will require digging out a pit of 1.8 meters in depth and 1.5 meters in diameter.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">Where do you have this much open space?</h4>
<p>How close is the location to the water supply and distribution plumbing line?<br />
Laying long supply pipelines involves enormous costs and reduces water pressure at outlets.<br />
So, storage tanks should not be placed far from the building&#8217;s main water supply plumbing<br />
system; otherwise, you may need to spend electricity for pumping and maintaining water<br />
pressure across the building.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">Is there any sewer nearby?</h4>
<p>Ori-Plast&#8217;s underground PVC water tanks are anti-corrosive, chemical-resistant and offer<br />
excellent protection from surrounding seepages. However, if possible, installing underground<br />
water tanks away from sewers is advisable. It helps to avoid accidental damage to any of the<br />
systems.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">How far is the foundation of the building?</h4>
<p>We should try to avoid digging underground water storage pits closer to building foundations.<br />
Modern-day concrete building foundations are massively strong. The closeness of the<br />
underground tank and the building&#8217;s foundation may cause future troubles, like damaging<br />
foundation concrete while repairing underground tanks.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">What is the soil structure?</h4>
<p>Some soil structures and rock formations are unsuitable for digging deeper and installing big<br />
water storage tanks. Loose rocks can cave in and put unnecessary structural pressure on an<br />
underground tank. Soil with excessive water retention capacity may increase the chances of<br />
corrosion over time.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">Is there any underground electric supply cable?</h4>
<p>Many municipal areas have underground electricity supply cables. You must stay away from<br />
building water supply lines and storage tanks near these areas.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">Conclusion</h4>
<p>It is crucial to place your underground water storage tank as per scientific principles. It will help<br />
you store water safely for long periods, promote a healthy lifestyle, and save money. Tell us<br />
about your experience with water storage tanks. Check Oriplast.com if you are looking for PVC<br />
underground water storage tanks. Ori-Plast offers only the best quality water storage tanks of<br />
different sizes at value-for-money pricing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With global<br />
warming causing long and unpredictably dry growing seasons, access to water is<br />
a rising problem in some parts of India. Drinking water, irrigation, or<br />
livestock water for animals has become a growing concern. Many farmers and<br />
agriculturalists are reviewing their irrigation systems to protect their crops.<br />
Fortunately, <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/lldpe-water-tank/">LLDPE water tanks</a></strong> can<br />
help you offset such dry spells and benefit irrigation.</p>
<h6><strong>Why Use Water Tank for Irrigation?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Irrigation<br />
tanks have been an age-old tradition in India. Water storage tanks are filled<br />
with natural water resources like rainfall and then stored to be used for<br />
mainly agricultural purposes, and also for domestic and other uses.</p>
<p>As the<br />
country is grappling with ground water depletion and erratic monsoon, tank<br />
water harvesting has become vital for industries like agriculture, food<br />
processing or construction.</p>
<p>As a leading <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/water-tanks/750-litre/">LLDPE water tank<br />
manufacturer</a></strong>, Ori-Plast provides hygienic and durable water storage<br />
solutionsthat help users take advantage of tank water irrigation.</p>
<h6><strong>Benefits of Tank Water Irrigation</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Tank water<br />
irrigation offers a host of benefits including replenishing groundwater levels,<br />
supplying drinking water to rural communities and domestic animals, protecting<br />
top soil and harboring fish. Let’s delve deeper into the benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Groundwater replenishment</strong> Water storage tanks can substantially<br />
replenish groundwater in drought-prone areas which otherwise depend on well<br />
irrigation.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrological balance </strong>By using tank and well irrigation in<br />
conjunction, you can achieve an enhanced hydrological equilibrium</li>
<li><strong>Bumper crop production</strong> Tank irrigation can benefit both<br />
landowners and laborers because farm activities are no longer dependent on<br />
seasonal rainfall; with water available for perennial irrigation, farming<br />
continues all year round, leading to more crop production.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits for small farmers </strong>The benefits of tank irrigation<br />
encourage small farmers to invest more in water storage tanks, due to the<br />
sustainability and high returns they provide.</li>
<li><strong>Other benefits </strong>Tank water also serves other essential<br />
needs like supplying drinking water, livestock rearing and harboring fish.</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>LLDPE Tank or Plastic Water Storage<br />
Tank</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>In recent<br />
years, plastic water tanks are increasingly being used for home use as well as<br />
for irrigation and commercial purposes. Plastic tanks are preferred over cement<br />
tanks or steel tanks because they cost less and are lightweight. Plus, high<br />
quality plastic tanks are non-toxic and do not interfere with the taste and<br />
odor of the water stored in them.</p>
<p>Some tanks<br />
react when exposed continuously to sunlight, but FDA approved polyethylene resins<br />
that constitute plastics, are safe to store food and water.</p>
</p>
<p>Ori-Plast utilizes<br />
latest technological innovations to design the LLDPE water tanks that are made<br />
from Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE).</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/water-tanks/1000-litre/">Ori-Plast water tanks</a> </strong>come in multiple layers with foam<br />
filled between the layers both on inside and outside. The layers prevent heat<br />
transmission, thereby ensuring that the water stored remains cooler than the external<br />
temperature. These tanks boast of excellent storage capacity, hygienic water<br />
storage and cost effectiveness. A preferred choice of users far and wide, LLDPE<br />
water tanks are leak proof and resistant to corrosion and chemicals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When looking to install a water tank in your home, it pays to know how much water your family consumes, as well as the options available in the market that can meet your needs efficiently.</p>
<p>In India, the average household water consumption per person isnearly225.13 litres a day (6754 litres of water per month). However, water usage runs much higher during the summer months. This is perhaps why our 1000 litre water tanks are one of the most widely in-demand sizes in the market. It’s perfect for meeting the daily water requirements of a 4-member household, while it’s large enough to cater to the needs of a moderate-size family.</p>
<p>So, if you’re looking for a water tank with ample storage capacity at a competitive price, you won’t go wrong with OriPlast 1000 litres tank.</p>
<p>In this article, we dive into some key things to know before purchasing our 1000 ltr water tank.</p>
<h6><strong>Easy on your pocket</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>As a core brand principle, OriPlast believes in combining quality and cost-efficiency. And, this reflects in our 1000 litre water tank price, which is competitive and offers excellent value for money.</p>
<p>The 1000 ltr water tank is not only budget-friendly but also makes for a smart choice in terms of the amount of time needed to fill it up to its fullest capacity. For instance, a 1000 ltr tank needs to be filled just once a day for a family of four that one on average consumes 900 ltr per day, thus, saving electricity usage.</p>
<h6><strong>Superior quality build</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Manufactured with precision from high-quality linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), these tanks ensure safe water storage. The food-grade material makes these tanks an excellent option for storing drinking water. Plus, they are leak-proof and highly resistant to corrosion and chemicals — further ensuring that the water you get is clean, potable, and fit for drinking.</p>
<p>So when you choose OriPlast, you have peace of mind knowing that you and your family can enjoy clean and 100% safe water for years to come.</p>
<h6><strong>Check for variations</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Another great thing about choosing OriPlast 1000 ltr tank is the range of varieties you can pick from. While our standard LLDPE tanks are double-layered, we also offer Triple and Four-layered tanks that are manufactured with foam linings sandwiched between the inner and outer layers. This prevents the transmission of heat between the stored water and the external environment, helping maintain a balanced water temperature regardless of the season. Of course, Oriplast <a href="https://oriplast.com/lldpe-water-tank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1000 litre water tank price</a> will vary accordingly.</p>
<p>When buying our 1000 litres water tank, remember to check for the variation you wish to purchase for your home.</p>
<h6><strong>Durability for years</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Every 1000 ltr water tank we manufacture is done so under rigorous quality guidelines while maintaining strict adherence to the national as well as international standards. Once you have purchased an OriPlast water tank, you can rest assured that it will last for years with little care and maintenance.</p>
