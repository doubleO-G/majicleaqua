										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life changes fast, sometimes even without blinking an eyelid. People in the midst of the<br />
whirlwind keep wondering what just happened, how to react to the situation, and what meaning<br />
to make out of the new reality! But life continues. And many times, we end up responding<br />
superfluously. Think of a movie superstar with all his on-screen action heropanti and<br />
extraordinary jubilation suddenly finds himself in an utterly contradicting plot in real life. It may<br />
not be of his own making. But he, anyhow, ends up at the receiving end as life is never fair. How<br />
will he fight back? Will he live up to the reel-life action hero he portrays in movies? Or will he<br />
have to get down on his knees? For the answer, visit your nearest movie theatre, as An Action<br />
Hero is releasing on 2nd December 2022. It is a movie of Anand L. Rai&#8217;s production, directed<br />
by Anirudh Iyer. Ori-Plast, the hero of PVC plumbing solutions in its own right, is delighted to<br />
announce its association with this Ayushmann Khurana movie.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">About An Action Hero</h4>
<p>&#8216;An Action Hero&#8217; is an out-and-out thriller with edge-of-the-seat suspense and drama. Movie<br />
superstar Maanav goes to Haryana for an outdoor shoot but gets involved in an accident that<br />
turns his life upside down. A man got killed. The deceased&#8217;s brother vows to hunt down Maanav<br />
and take revenge. Subplots emerge and make Maanav&#8217;s life a living hell; a superhero with<br />
millions of fan-following suddenly finds himself at his wit&#8217;s end. We do not want to spoil your<br />
excitement. So, no more clues. The explosive performances of Ayushmann Khurrana and<br />
Jaideep Ahlawat will never let your thrill go down.</p>

So, be ready. Karnasubarner Guptodhon will hit the screens this Friday, the 30th of September 2022. Ori-Plast is delighted to announce its association with this Bangla treasure hunt feature film.</p>

<p>We do not want to spoil the excitement of Sona-da fans waiting with bated breath. So, there is no spoiler alert.

Its fame was widespread across the length and width of ancient India and beyond. We expect Sona-da to shed some new light on this City’s past and take us back to the glorious period of the Gauda kingdom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is about being an early adopter. Ori-Plast is a household name today because we have been early adopters of the latest technologies in every process of our business, starting from designing, manufacturing, distribution to pre and post-sales customer servicing.</p>
<p>We are the pioneers in manufacturing PVC and HDPE piping solutions in India. We continue to innovate with PVC-O products, a specialized product segment targeted at the municipal space.</p>
<p>We have also been an early adopter of digital transactions and have supported our channel partners in becoming comfortable with digital payment gateways and mobile wallets.</p>
<p>This has propelled us to become a one-stop shop for all residential, commercial, municipal, industrial and agricultural needs for fluid handling and fluid-storage products and solutions.</p>
<h6><strong>In a dense industry like yours, how have you innovated to stay ahead of the curve?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>I would say that we have been market leaders by providing end-to-end fluid handling and storage product solutions to its customers.</p>
<p>We are a solution-oriented company. The idea behind such a position is to better satisfy the customer through a single-window rather than have her go from one supplier to another to comprehensively meet all requirements.</p>
<h6><strong>What is the core offering of the Company?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>We offer awe-inspiring fluid handling and fluid-storage product baskets of wide varieties, manufactured with the best quality materials and following the highest quality standards. Our products are competitively priced and supported by superb pre &amp; post-sales services.</p>
<h6><strong>Take us back to the genesis of the Company to where it is today.</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Ori-Plast is an over 5-decade old enterprise and a pioneering leader in PVC &amp; PE pipes, fittings &amp; allied items in Eastern India. The Company was founded by a visionary entrepreneur Mr. S. R. Agarwal, in 1965.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Kolkata, the Company is one of the largest PVC pipe manufacturers with four state-of-the-art ISO 9001 certified manufacturing facilities at Balasore in Odisha, Behror in Rajasthan, Bagnan &amp; Sankrail in West Bengal.</p>
<p>With “Life Line … not just Pipe Lines” as the corporate motto, Ori-Plast offers unsurpassed quality and superior features, increasing durability, improving performance, and facilitating ease of installation of products–providing enhanced value for end-customers and installers.</p>
<p>By being innovative and quality conscious, Ori-Plast distinguishes itself from other generic plumbing products manufacturers through an in-built culture of holistic customer care.</p>
<h6><strong>Any entrepreneurial journey is challenging. How have you overcome obstacles?</strong></h6>
<p>Yes. There have been many challenges, but we have faced them with fortitude and thought out-of-the-box to ensure that we overcome them.</p>
<p>For example, initially, we had a limited vendor ecosystem. We mitigated this by sourcing domestically and from abroad and also through handholding and development of smaller ancillary units.</p>
<p>Then, we have constantly adopted global best practices and evolved in an increasingly dynamic statutory and regulatory environment.</p>
<p>Also, consumer preferences can change fast and are much influenced by many different factors. We keep up by upgrading our technologies and processes. Moreover, our customer engagement initiatives aim at understanding the wants of customers across industries, which further guides us in developing products to fulfill not only present demand, but innovate to cater to future needs as well.</p>
<h6><strong>What makes the Company stand out?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>It would definitely be our ability to innovate. We have been innovating ever since our inception. We have created new segments in the space of plastic piping for water, PE piping for gas, and PVC-O products, a specialized product targeted at the municipal space.</p>
<p>A culture of continuous innovation has created a reputation wherein our customers and channel partners trust us to give them world-class made-in-India products.</p>
<h6><strong>What is the roadmap for the future?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Over the next five years, we intend to replace metal piping with plastic piping and products wherever possible. We can turn the curse of the non-degradability of plastic into a virtue and make it the material of choice for durable products where longevity is needed and appreciated. It would make plastic a greener alternative for other conventional materials being used.</p>
<p>Also, piping made of plastic for gas and other demanding applications is one of the several key areas where we see our future growth.</p>
<h6><strong>Overall, what are the special attributes or qualities of the Company?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>In a nutshell, We offer competitively priced, global-standard quality in made-in-India products with unmatched customer servicing. Further, our R&amp;D capabilities and the ability to adopt and transform through innovation sets us apart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6><strong>5 User Benefits You Should Hunt Before Buying PVC Garden Pipes</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Leakage and ruptures are frustrating. Imagine you are taking care of your lawn or watering a stack of freshly laid bricks with a garden hose, and suddenly water pressure starts dropping, only to realise later that the water is gushing out from leakage in the tube somewhere. All of us have our moments of failures with cheap, generic garden pipes. But they are indispensable. So, along with PVC garden pipe prices, be more cautious about a few other factors to avoid common frustrations in your gardening and lawn care experience.</p>
<h6><strong>PVC garden pipes &#8211; a few facts</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>If you didn’t know, PVC garden pipes are flexible tubes used in drenching concrete, brick structures, watering gardens, lawns and other general-purpose water transporting purposes. The flexibility of garden pipes is particularly beneficial for the particular purposes they serve. It helps to reach and irrigate every nook and corner of the garden, structure without disrupting the flow. Besides, you can quickly and nicely roll PVC garden hoses after use and store them without taking too much space or time.</p>
<h6><strong>Look out for The FIVE benefits while buying a PVC garden pipe?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>An excellent quality PVC garden hose can have various intended and unintended applications. For optimum usability and longevity, you should identify the primary uses to help you choose the best fit for your tasks. Here is the list of the 5 factors you should look out for in a PVC garden pipe.</p>
<h6><strong>Material strength</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>With the proper devices and skills, it is technically possible to measure the tensile strength of any material, let alone PVC garden pipes. However, it might be beyond the capability of ordinary end-users. However, you can always tie one side with something fixed and pull the other side of a garden pipe with brute physical force to have a rough idea of its material strength. Poor material quality will give into stretching. A good quality PVC will survive repeated stretching.</p>
<h6><strong>Flexibility, durability </strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>One easy way to check the flexibility of PVC garden pipes is to bend and twist a garden pipe and check how long it can last without showing any permanent damage or tear. Best PVC garden pipes must be flexible without compromising durability.</p>
<h6><strong>Dimensional accuracy</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Often people choose garden hosepipes of incorrect sizes compared to their water sources (like tap size) and application requirements. PVC garden pipes of larger diameter than tap size result in water pressure drops; smaller diameter pipes create excess pressure and wastage of water through connector points. So, always make sure to choose the dimensionally accurate PVC garden tubes. The best quality PVC garden pipes and connectors manufacturers, Ori-Plast, offer pipes in a wide range of sizes for the best possible fit.</p>
<h6><strong>Absence of cracks, leaks</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Companies with poor manufacturing standards often fail to quality control and sell PVC garden pipes with minute hairline cracks and leaks that are visually difficult to identify in a cursory look. Be careful. A tube with even the tiniest crack might fail to survive flowing water under pressure. You should ask retailers to check or test it yourself if possible. As a top branded PVC garden pipes manufacturer, Ori-Plast takes extreme care of product quality so that our end-users do not need to bother. Besides, our reliable product return policy assures flawless customer experience for manufacturing defects, if any.</p>
<h6><strong>UV stability</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>People use garden pipes primarily in outdoor applications like lawn care, gardening, irrigation and construction. Exposure to sunlight, heat and other external factors reduce colour and material strength. So, your pipe should be UV stable. Our PVC garden pipes are made of materials with UV stabilising agents and UV protective coating for long term durability and colour longevity.</p>
<p>Do you love the calming experience of watering garden plants? Or, do you need a tube for watering your newly constructed wall? Choose only the top quality PVC garden pipes for the best value for money and your peace of mind. Contact us to check PVC garden pipe prices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PVC and HDPE are without doubt the two most popular pipes used in underground construction. However, there is considerable debate as to which pipe is the best to work with when it comes to piping solutions for homes and businesses. Both PVC and HDPE pipes have their strengths and weaknesses and it can be hard to choose one.<br />
Here’s a comparison between <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/pvc-pipes/">PVC pipes</a> </strong> and HDPE to help you decide which pipe to work with for your plumbing needs.</p>
<h6><strong>What are PVC and HDPE Pipes?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) and HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) pipes and fittings are extensively used in water piping systems. PVC pipes and HDPE pipes have some common characteristics which make them a preferred choice for a wide array of applications.<br />
Both are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Made of plastic</li>
<li>Lightweight</li>
<li>Resistant to Corrosion</li>
<li>Resistant to bacterial and chemical build-up</li>
<li>Have higher life expectancy than metallic pipes</li>
</ul>
<h6>Differences between PVC pipe fittings and HDPE pipe fittings</h6>
<p></br></p>
<h6>Durability</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC is a durable vinyl polymer whereas HDPE is a polyethylene thermoplastic made from petroleum. Both pipes are strong through high temperatures. When comparing failure ratings when exposed to events like rain, stress, wind, heat or cold, HDPE is proven to be more durable. PVC pipes has a rating of one in 48,650 events; HDPE one in 10,000,000 events.<br />
<strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/pvc-pipes/suppliers/">Flexible PVC pipe</a></strong> however is more valuable for one time<br />
projects.</p>
<h6>Joining</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Gasket or<br />
gluing sealant is used to join PVC pipes. HDPE pipes are joined by heat fusion.<br />
Hence, while <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/pvc-pipes/suppliers/">PVC pipe fittings</a></strong> can<br />
be joined underwater, HDPE cannot.<br />
But HDPE<br />
pipes can withstand and dampen more shock waves compared to PVC.</p>
<h6>Thermal Performance</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Continuous exposure to hot or cold weather results in slow expansion of pipes and fittings. HDPE pipes expand four times more than PVC pipes.</p>
<h6>Installation</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC can be<br />
installed in Open Trench and Drop Burial ways. Installation is easy and quick;<br />
not dependant on weather conditions, and requires no particular machinery.<br />
Overall <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/pvc-pipes/">PVC Pipe price</a></strong> is quite low.</p>
<p>HDPE pipes<br />
can be installed in Open Trench, Drop Burial, Directional Bore, and Horizontal<br />
Bore ways. Trained personnel and energy intensive equipment are needed for<br />
installing HDPE fittings. <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/hdpe-pipes/fittings/">HDPE pipe price</a></strong> can be higher.</p>
<h6>Leakage</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC pipes are stronger and stiffer, so they can be mechanically joined to valves, non-plastic fittings. A major drawback is water leakage through these joints.<br />
The softer and more bendable HDPE pipes provide leak-free joints to prevent water leakage.</p>
<h6>Use in Irrigation</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC pipes are extensively used for irrigation. However, more people prefer HDPE pipes for irrigation systems where digging is hard or impossible. For golf-course irrigation systems, HDPE pipes are best suited.</p>
<h6>Applications</h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The most common application of PVC pipesis in water-piping at homes. These are also used for sewers, drains, irrigation and industrial purposes.<br />
HDPE has more expansive uses — for distribution of natural gas, petroleum and chemicals. These are also used in water, sanitary and storm sewer systems.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you are upgrading your plumbing system or planning the next plumbing project, it’s important to choose the right type of pipe for the job. It is becoming more common to replace metal water pipes by polymer pipes due to the many advantages of plastic over metal. Let us find out what makes Polymer pipes, more commonly known as PVC pipes,stronger and more popular than metal pipes.</p>
<p><a href="https://oriplast.com/polymer-bath-fittings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polymer pipes</a> are most commonly made of Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which is a combination of plastic and vinyl. There are also CPVC (chlorinatedpolyvinyl chloride) piping, PERT (polyethylene-raised temperature) and others to choose from. The safety, durability, cost efficiency and recyclability of polymer piping have made it a preferred choice for various piping applications ranging from drinking water transportation, to drainage systems to fire sprinkler solutions.</p>
<h6><strong>Advantages of Using Plastic Pipes over Metals Pipes</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The word “plastic” mean pliable, or something that can be easily shaped. This property of plastics and numerous other features make it a valuable raw material for the piping industry.</p>
<h6><strong>Safety</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Polymer pipes are a safe choice for transporting clean, healthy drinking water. These pipes offer high degree of inertness and resistance to corrosion, which makes them free from bio-film contamination that leads to bacterial growth.</p>
<p>Besides, there are risks like accidents and injuries involved in manufacturing metal parts. Plastic, being comparatively softer and smoother, is safer and easily moldable.</p>
<h6><strong>Durability</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The expected lifespan of an underground polymer pipe can extend over 100 years. One of the main reasons for such longer life is the ability of plastics to withstand physical, chemical, environmental and weather attacks. Metals, on the other hand, are highly prone to chemical and weather attacks –one of the key reasons why plastic pipes are preferred over metal pipes.</p>
<h6><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC pipes are the most cost effective choices compared to other piping materials. The cost to purchase, install, maintain and operate is significantly lower than metals. Home owners and industries can safely choose plastic pipes for their piping needs.</p>
<h6><strong>Lightweight</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Plastic pipes are much more light weight than their metal counterparts, weighing ten times less than steel. Reducing part weight is one the major concerns of any industry. Replacing heavy metal pipes can be a major, expensive operation.</p>
<h6><strong>Environment Friendly</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Since polymer is a low carbon plastic, PVC have definite environmental advantages over other materials. Polymer pipes are more efficient to manufacture in terms of energy consumption, and are non toxic, which helps the environment.</p>
<p>Metal pipes are susceptible to leakage, which leads to water loss and ultimately higher water bills. Plastic water pipes can help conserve water through reduced leakage.</p>
<h6><strong>Recyclability</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The biggest advantage of plastic over metals is that plastic can be recycled. Polymer pipes can be melted and reused several times, while metal pipes once damaged must be discarded and replaced.</p>
<h6><strong>Faster Manufacturing</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Plastics can be easily manufactured in comparison to metals. Shorter production cycle contributes to higher cost efficiency.</p>
