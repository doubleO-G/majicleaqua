										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you aware of the storage tank layers? There are two common types of plastic (PVC) water<br />
storage tanks&#8211;walls made of a single layer of PVC and walls made of multiple layers. In<br />
general, single-layer tanks are cheaper than multiple-layer water tanks. The reasons are the<br />
lower sealing cost and lesser production complexities for manufacturing single-layer tanks.<br />
These tanks can also be comparatively lighter. However, multi-layer water tanks have various<br />
advantages, like ensuring water safety, longevity, strength and durability.<br />
Do you want to learn about what is the optimal number of layers for vertical PVC and other<br />
thermoplastic water storage tanks? We have highlighted and discussed some critical<br />
considerations.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">What is a water storage tank?</h4>
<p>The term water tank quite clearly self-explains its uses. But there exists a wide range of tanks<br />
for storing water with various industrial, commercial and residential use cases. Depending on<br />
the usage, a water tank needs to have specific characteristics. For example, concerns about<br />
water safety may not be essential in many industries storing water for cooling, fire extinguishing<br />
or similar purposes. But, keeping the stored water safe (food-grade) is critical in residential<br />
houses, food processing industries, hospitality or healthcare facilities. So, one size or one type<br />
of tank does not fit all.</p>
<p>The quality of water storage depends on various factors like materials, fit and finish, and the<br />
number of layers used in constructing tanks&#8217; walls. A water storage tank is a vital part of any<br />
household. We need to store drinking water, ensure a steady water supply across faucets and<br />
maintain the quality of stored water with reliability over time.</p>
<p>The types of multi-layer water storage tanks<br />
Multi-layer tanks can be made of a minimum of 2 layers and a maximum of 5 layers. Each layer<br />
comes with a specific feature and offers particular customer benefits. We need to understand<br />
each layer&#8217;s benefits for making the right choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-layer water storage tanks &#8211; These tanks have been available in the market for a<br />
long time; the inner layer comes in contact with stored water. So, it is made of<br />
food-grade virgin PVC material. The outer layer protects the inner layer from weather<br />
and UV exposure.</li>
<li>Triple-layer tanks &#8211; This type of tank usually has a foam insert between the inner and<br />
outer PVC layers. Foam does not convey heat. So, water inside the tank does not heat<br />
up quickly even while exposed to scorching summer sun and does not lose temperature<br />
during cold winter nights.</li>
<li>Four-layer tanks &#8211; These tanks contain an extra layer of foam to ensure better heat<br />
insulation and sturdier built quality.</li>
<li>Five-layer tanks &#8211; This type of water tank has a reflective shield on the outer layer along<br />
with a UV protection layer. An extra layer of foam between two linear outer and inner<br />
layers offers comparatively better heat insulation, even in a wide range of weather<br />
conditions for years. All these protections make 5-layer tanks more durable.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Keeping track of the number of layers in your storage tank may seem like an unnecessary task<br />
at first, but it will help you maintain your storage capacity and avoid unnecessary expenses in<br />
the long run. You should also note that different brands of PVC pipe come with varying<br />
thicknesses and therefore varying numbers of layers. It&#8217;s best to check with your manufacturer<br />
before purchasing. The optimal number of layers for your water storage tanks depends on the<br />
end uses. It is advisable to choose tanks of 3 and more layers to store food-grade potable<br />
water. Ori-Plast manufactures all types of multi-layer water tanks. The Company offers excellent<br />
fit and finishes, long-term durability and consistent quality at competitive pricing across all tanks.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong> 7 tips to ensure the best water tank position in your home as per VASTU</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Something as simple as the place of a water tank, according to Vastu, can make or break the livability quotient of your house. Vastu says we should avoid being whimsical while constructing homes or any other buildings. Every construction decision should comply with Vastu guidelines; otherwise, it might disturb the lives of people residing and working there.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is Vastu Shastra?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today we consult civil engineers for structural building plans. Architects help us to design our living space and interior. But for thousands of years, Vastu experts were our very own civil engineers and architectures. They helped planning buildings, structures, temples, forts and whatnot. Kings and wealthy people used to take Vastu guidance to make homes livable. There are hundreds of scriptures on Vastu Shastra, written in Sanskrit, that still exist. Even today, millions of families take the help of Vastu experts while constructing houses in India.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Akash</strong>,(space), <strong>Vayu</strong>,(air),<strong>, Agni</strong>,(fire), <strong>,Jal</strong>,(water) and <strong>,Prithvi</strong>, (earth),- our world is made of these 5 elements (Panchatatva). VASTU Shastra says that to lead a prosperous, happy and fulfilling life, we need to align our living space with nature and balance these elements around us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The position of water storage tanks in our houses is one of the many factors that help maintain balance in Panchatatva.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong> Seven tips for water tank position as per Vastu</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>All water tanks are not the same</strong>. It might sound strange, but water storage tanks differ in nature and implications in Vastu. Underground water tanks, which we primarily use as reservoirs, are considered as a water element. On the other hand, overhead tanks act like earth elements. So, according to Vastu, even if both types store water, their position and direction must be different.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Water elements in nature align in North and North-East</strong>. So, underground water tanks should be positioned in any of these two positions in your house. North is the best direction for constructing and placing underground water reserves; if it is not feasible, Vastu experts suggest North-East or East directions. West direction can also help to balance and align water elements. Vastu strictly prohibited placing water tanks in the South direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The best position for earth elements is in the southwest direction.</strong> So, as earth elements in nature, overhead tanks should be positioned in the southwest, west or south directions. Strictly avoid north for placing overhead tanks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The best time to finalize the water tank position</strong> is at the time of designing the construction blueprint. We often forget to consider Vastu compatibility and start tweaking design and plan at the last moment. It not only hampers the overall Vastu alignment of the property but also increases the cost. Sometimes, the defect becomes irreparable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rectifying the ill effects of an incorrectly positioned water tank is never easy.</strong> We cannot just relocate the tank in a better direction and start believing that Vastu is aligned. Rectifying Vastu mistakes sometimes require a complete overhaul of construction; otherwise, Panchatatva cannot enter, flow and exit correctly into the house. So, you should consult a Vastu expert only.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Avoid negative energies from water tanks.</strong>Negative energies can flow from overhead water storage tanks due to various reasons like choosing tanks of incorrect colours, not using cover, not cleaning tanks regularly and others. The most suitable colours for rooftop or terrace tanks are white, grey and yellow. The most negative colours for these tanks are red, green and orange.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use demarcated and separated pipes </strong>for different inlets and outlets of water.Take the example of plumbing pipes supplying water to the kitchen, toilet and garden. Avoid using the same outlet pipes for the kitchen and bathroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why leave anything to chance while building your home? Build an underground water tank as per Vastu. Making a house costs a significant investment and involves a lot of emotions. Aligning your water tank direction as per Vastu might not cost you anything extra, especially if you choose <a href="https://oriplast.com/lldpe-water-tank/">Ori-Plast water storage tanks</a>. But it can indeed assure you peace of mind &amp; water tank vastu now you can choose your water tank position according to Vastu.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With global<br />
warming causing long and unpredictably dry growing seasons, access to water is<br />
a rising problem in some parts of India. Drinking water, irrigation, or<br />
livestock water for animals has become a growing concern. Many farmers and<br />
agriculturalists are reviewing their irrigation systems to protect their crops.<br />
Fortunately, <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/lldpe-water-tank/">LLDPE water tanks</a></strong> can<br />
help you offset such dry spells and benefit irrigation.</p>
<h6><strong>Why Use Water Tank for Irrigation?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Irrigation<br />
tanks have been an age-old tradition in India. Water storage tanks are filled<br />
with natural water resources like rainfall and then stored to be used for<br />
mainly agricultural purposes, and also for domestic and other uses.</p>
<p>As the<br />
country is grappling with ground water depletion and erratic monsoon, tank<br />
water harvesting has become vital for industries like agriculture, food<br />
processing or construction.</p>
<p>As a leading <strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/water-tanks/750-litre/">LLDPE water tank<br />
manufacturer</a></strong>, Ori-Plast provides hygienic and durable water storage<br />
solutionsthat help users take advantage of tank water irrigation.</p>
<h6><strong>Benefits of Tank Water Irrigation</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Tank water<br />
irrigation offers a host of benefits including replenishing groundwater levels,<br />
supplying drinking water to rural communities and domestic animals, protecting<br />
top soil and harboring fish. Let’s delve deeper into the benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Groundwater replenishment</strong> Water storage tanks can substantially<br />
replenish groundwater in drought-prone areas which otherwise depend on well<br />
irrigation.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrological balance </strong>By using tank and well irrigation in<br />
conjunction, you can achieve an enhanced hydrological equilibrium</li>
<li><strong>Bumper crop production</strong> Tank irrigation can benefit both<br />
landowners and laborers because farm activities are no longer dependent on<br />
seasonal rainfall; with water available for perennial irrigation, farming<br />
continues all year round, leading to more crop production.</li>
<li><strong>Benefits for small farmers </strong>The benefits of tank irrigation<br />
encourage small farmers to invest more in water storage tanks, due to the<br />
sustainability and high returns they provide.</li>
<li><strong>Other benefits </strong>Tank water also serves other essential<br />
needs like supplying drinking water, livestock rearing and harboring fish.</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>LLDPE Tank or Plastic Water Storage<br />
Tank</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>In recent<br />
years, plastic water tanks are increasingly being used for home use as well as<br />
for irrigation and commercial purposes. Plastic tanks are preferred over cement<br />
tanks or steel tanks because they cost less and are lightweight. Plus, high<br />
quality plastic tanks are non-toxic and do not interfere with the taste and<br />
odor of the water stored in them.</p>
<p>Some tanks<br />
react when exposed continuously to sunlight, but FDA approved polyethylene resins<br />
that constitute plastics, are safe to store food and water.</p>
</p>
<p>Ori-Plast utilizes<br />
latest technological innovations to design the LLDPE water tanks that are made<br />
from Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE).</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://oriplast.com/water-tanks/1000-litre/">Ori-Plast water tanks</a> </strong>come in multiple layers with foam<br />
filled between the layers both on inside and outside. The layers prevent heat<br />
transmission, thereby ensuring that the water stored remains cooler than the external<br />
temperature. These tanks boast of excellent storage capacity, hygienic water<br />
storage and cost effectiveness. A preferred choice of users far and wide, LLDPE<br />
water tanks are leak proof and resistant to corrosion and chemicals.</p>
