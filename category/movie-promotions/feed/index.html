										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A thriller that will leave you spellbound</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have you ever come across news of a crime so gruesome that you wished the perpetrators of the crime received the punishment they deserved? Often, we feel that life imprisonment or imprisonment for a few years does not justify the crime that they have committed. The story of Doctor Bakshi revolves around the same theme. In the story, will the perpetrators receive the punishment they deserve? Will we, as the movie audience, feel that justice was served by its plot? The answer will be provided by Doctor Bakshi. The film is scheduled to be available for viewing in theaters near you on January 20, 2023. Saptaswa Basu directed the film, and Saptarshi Sen produced it. Ori-Plast, the best pipe manufacturer in Kolkata, is excited to announce its involvement with this tightly plotted film.</p>

The character of the novelist in the film, played by Subhashree Ganguly, is working on her new novel when she gets trapped in a murder mystery in real life. That&#8217;s when Doctor Bakshi uses his medical skills to solve the riddles of the past to help bring justice to the characters for their own deeds and the wrongdoings of others that they had to go through. We do not want to spoil your excitement. So, no more clues. The explosive performances of Parambrata Chatterjee and Subhashree Ganguly will never let your thrill go down.</p>
