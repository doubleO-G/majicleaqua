										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) pipes have become a popular choice for plumbers and DIYers due to their corrosion resistance, cost savings, and easy installation. If you&#8217;re looking to upgrade your water lines or replace old pipes, learning how to install CPVC correctly is key to creating a reliable system. Follow this guide to <strong>install CPVC pipes in your home like an expert</strong>.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Planning the Layout</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first step when taking on any new plumbing project is planning. Map out where you want to run the CPVC lines and measure the required lengths. Ensure you have enough room to make clean cuts and proper connections. If installing in tight spaces like under sinks or in crawl spaces, allow extra working room. Consider using elbow joints over sharp 90-degree cuts when turning corners.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Preparing the Pipes and Fittings</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before assembling, inspect and clean all <a href="https://oriplast.com/cpvc-pipes-fittings/"><strong>CPVC pipes and fittings</strong></a>. Look for any defects, debris, or cracks. Lightly sanding the ends will also improve adhesion. Dry all pieces completely, as CPVC cement won&#8217;t bond well to damp surfaces. Having the right primer and solvent cement is also critical &#8211; they must be formulated for bonding CPVC.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Cutting the Pipe</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A miter box and fine-toothed CPVC cutter are essential for straight, burr-free cuts. Mark your measurements, securing the pipe firmly in the miter box. Score all around the pipe with a cutter in one continuous stroke applying firm pressure. Avoid over-cutting too deep or sawing back and forth. After scoring, bend the pipe slightly to snap cleanly along the cut line.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Deburring and Beveling</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Use a pocket knife or metal deburring tool to remove any ridges or rough edges from pipe ends. This prevents gouging the fittings when inserted. Then chamfer the outer edge by lightly filing at a 30-45 degree angle. This flare will allow the fitting to slide over easier. Avoid over-beveling too far down the small diameter.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Applying Solvent Cements</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The primer helps soften and prep the surfaces, while the solvent cement fuses them together. Use a small dauber applicator, applying a thin coat of purple primer into the pipe&#8217;s inner socket and fitting end. Then quickly apply gray CPVC cement the same way. Assemble parts immediately while wet, twisting lightly to distribute cement evenly. Hold 30 seconds to set. Excess cement can be wiped with a clean rag.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Supporting the Pipe</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Proper pipe support is also critical for professional results and inspection. CPVC should be secured at least every 3 feet for horizontal runs or base of vertical lengths. Use clamps lined with rubber or vinyl protectors to prevent bruising. Space clamps no wider than 18 inches for 1/2 inch pipe, or 36 inches for 3/4 inch or larger. Allowing pipes to flex will risk future leaks.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Pressure Testing</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before completing project walls or ceilings, always pressure test new CPVC systems. Slowly pressurize the lines to monitor for any leaks, sealing them with additional cement if found. Consider leaving key system areas accessible rather than burying lines. Also confirm local plumbing codes which may require inspector approval.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following this guide will ensure safe, long-lasting CPVC installations. Take things slow, prepping correctly before permanently bonding pipes and fittings. With some practice, youâ€™ll find CPVC systems easy to work with using basic hand tools. Just as reliable as copper, at a fraction of the cost, CPVC is the ideal choice for do-it-yourselfers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steps for Installing CPVC Pipes and Fittings</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a step-by-step guide for installing CPVC pipes and fittings:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 1: Plan the Plumbing System</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan the plumbing system, including the layout, the number of pipes, and the fittings required.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 2: Cut the CPVC Pipes and Fittings</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measure and mark the pipes and fittings to the required length. Cut the pipes and fittings using a hacksaw or pipe cutter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 3: Smooth the Edges</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use sandpaper or emery cloth to smooth the edges of the cut pipes and fittings to remove any burrs or sharp edges.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 4: Clean the Pipes and Fittings</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a cloth to clean the pipes and fittings. Apply a CPVC primer to the surfaces of the pipes and fittings that will be bonded together.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 5: Apply the CPVC Adhesive</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply a small amount of CPVC adhesive to the surfaces of the pipes and fittings that will be bonded together. Insert the pipe into the fitting and twist it slightly to ensure a proper fit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Step 6: Hold the Pipes and Fittings in Place</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hold the pipes and fittings in place for a few seconds to ensure a secure bond.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chrome plating and stainless steel are two of the most commonly used metal finishes in the<br />
construction industry. From residential kitchens and baths to commercial kitchens, homeowners<br />
often choose one over the other based on aesthetics and maintenance needs. Let&#8217;s take a<br />
closer look at these two popular finishes so you can make an informed decision.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">What is Chrome Plating?</h4>
<p>Chrome plating involves covering any material (metal or PVC) with a thin layer of chromium.<br />
Technically, as far as metal objects are concerned, the technique is called electroplating.<br />
However, polymers do not react to electroplating. They are first dipped in a chrome sulfur or<br />
palladium chloride bath. It etches the initial metal layer. Then, the polymer core object is<br />
electroplated. The bright finish of chrome makes any object better polished and modern look,<br />
feel and protection against elements. It is especially applicable to bath fittings and fixtures.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">Why is Chrome-plated PVC polymer better than Stainless<br />
Steel?</h4>
<p>There are several reasons that make modern chrome-plated (CP) PVC bath fittings and fixtures<br />
a better alternative to conventional metal and stainless steel products.</p>
<p>1. Chrome plating offers better shine and lustre than stainless steel. Even the highly<br />
polished SS fittings lose their lustre over time. Chrome does not require polishing and<br />
retains shine much longer, even without regular maintenance.</p>
<p>2. PVC fittings and fixtures are much lighter than SS metal alternatives. It allows easy<br />
handling, installation and maintenance.</p>
<p>3. Polymer fittings and fixtures are easy to shape in various styles, making them a better<br />
choice in terms of look and feel than metals.</p>
<p>4. Unlike stainless steel, <a href="https://oriplast.com/cpvc-pipes-fittings/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color:#4B4B56;">chrome-plated PVC fittings</a> are better for hot and cold water<br />
supply as you get the least tactile variation in temperature while using fittings in<br />
bathrooms or kitchens.</p>
<p>5. Modern PVC polymers offer the same level of sturdiness as metal fittings at a much<br />
more affordable price.</p>
<p>6. Chrome-plated PVC offers better value for money against water-induced corrosion and<br />
sedimentation.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">CP or SS: which is right for you?</h4>
<p>Choosing between chrome-plated and stainless steel is a matter of use cases and personal<br />
preference. Areas with high mineral content in water may reduce the life span of metal fittings<br />
and fixtures, but chrome plating can help. Stainless steel might have a traditional feel. On the<br />
other hand, choose chrome plating if you are looking for a shiny, modern look. Besides, you can<br />
redesign your bathroom or kitchen with a <a href="https://oriplast.com/bath-fittings/chromium-plated/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" style="color:#4B4B56;">new set of CP fittings</a> within a limited budget; it may<br />
not be possible if you opt for stainless steel.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">How to take care of CP fittings and fixtures?</h4>
<p>Water spots or fingerprints on the surface of fittings and fixtures reduce their shine. It makes<br />
them dull and worn. However, too much scrubbing can also damage the surface. So, gently<br />
wipe clean chrome-plated fittings and fixtures with a dry cotton cloth. Avoid using harsh acidic,<br />
or alkaline cleaning agents.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4 mb-3 text-dark">Finally</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="justify">We take many things for granted in our lives. Be it the unconditional attention of our loved ones,<br />
unadulterated sacrifices they make in their lives for families or our ever-growing dependencies<br />
on their selflessness. We love them, adore them and still, somehow, forget to sense how<br />
indispensable they are in our everyday living consciousness. And at one delicate moment, when<br />
they start questioning the significance of their existence, lightning strikes! Reality dawns upon<br />
us. This is the prelude, if not in entirety, to the soon-to-be-released Bengali feature film<br />
SHREEMATI. Ori-Plast is delighted to announce the brandâ€™s association with this initiative. The<br />
story of the protagonist in this film resonates accurately with Ori-Plastâ€™s core brand identity, â€˜Life<br />
Lines â€¦ not just Pipe Linesâ€™. Healthy water is the source of healthy living. Unfortunately, we<br />
often ignore this fact and compromise water quality until it starts hurting our wellbeing.</p>
<p align="justify">The film tells the life saga of an ordinary woman whom we can casually mistake as someone<br />
close to our hearts or, simply, as one of our next-door neighbours. Her life takes an<br />
extraordinary turn when she doubts the meaning of her very existence in a world that she loved<br />
the most in her life.</p>
<p align="justify">The leading roles have been portrayed by Swastika Mukherjee and Soham Chakraborty. The<br />
film has been directed by Arjunn Dutta, critically acclaimed for his direction and screenplay in<br />
Abyakto (2018) and Guldasta (2020). The producer of Shreemati is Kan Singh Sodha(KSS).</p>
<p>Witness what happens to Shreemati and her family in your nearest cinema hall on the 8th of<br />
July 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the top benefits of polyvinyl thermoplastic pipes and fittings in plumbing applications is the ease of installation. PVC and other variants of PVCs are easy to join using solvent cement. However, regular PVC solvents do not work effectively with CPVC due to differences in molecular compositions. CPVC pipe solvents are specially designed cement for the purpose; take the example of Ori-Plast E-Z Weld CPVC solvent cement. If you want to learn more about CPVC solvent or are looking for the best CPVC pipe solvent, youâ€™ve come to the right place.</p>
<h5  class="mt-5 mb-4"><strong>Why is choosing the right CPVC Solvent important?</strong></h5>
<p>The right quality solvent for CPVC plumbing offers various advantages.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy and the fastest installation &#8211; </strong> Incorrect type of solvent does not join CPVC pipes and fittings adequately and takes an abnormally long time causing uneven joints. Good quality CPVC solvents make CPVC installation easy and faster.</li>
<li><strong>Leakage proof performance &#8211;</strong> The good quality CPVC solvent allows uniform bonding of CPVC molecules and zero chance of leakage of joints.</li>
<li><strong>CPVC-grade resistance to temperature fluctuation &#8211; </strong> CPVC pipes and fittings are especially suitable for carrying hot and cold water. Improper solvents do not survive such a wide range of temperature fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Height grade water safety &#8211; </strong> Zero chance of leakage and temperature resistance allow maintaining water safety.</li>
<li><strong>Reliable longevity &#8211; </strong> CPVC solvents also increase the longevity of CPVC plumbing systems without requiring regular maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="mt-5 mb-4"><strong>How does solvent CPVC work?</strong></h5>
<p>Solvent bonding differs from regular adhesive bonding. When applied to a polymer surface, solvent cement softens the polymer and causes interdiffusion between two adjoining surfaces of that material. Solvents dry up after being applied, meaning there are no additional layers &#8211; just one solid patch of consolidated material left.</p>
<h5 class="mt-5 mb-4"><strong>Which CPVC solvent is best?</strong></h5>
<p>There are different branded and generic CPVC solvent cement available in the market. However, you should consult an experienced plumber before selecting anyone. Generic solvents can be fractionally cheaper initially but do not ensure reliable plumbing, increasing the overall ownership and maintenance cost of the piping system. Ori-Plast is one of the top manufacturers of CPVC pipes, fittings and CPVC pipe solvents. Ori-Plastâ€™s E-Z Weld CPVC solvent 118 ml and other pack sizes are available at the best value for money prices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Material science has witnessed rapid changes in the last couple of decades, combined with innovations in manufacturing. It has brought in new variants of thermoplastics like Chlorinated polyvinyl or CPVC with specialised characteristics. There are many benefits of using CPVC or chlorinated plumbing pipes. Many homes and building owners may not fully realise the advantages and versatility of CPVC as a material for water supply pipelines. However, things are changing. If you want to know more about the best CPVC pipe for plumbing, stay with us.</p>
<h5 class="mt-5 mb-4"><strong>What is the difference between PVC and CPVC?</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">CPVC is manufactured through chlorination of regular polyvinyl thermoplastic, and that&#8217;s why we call it Chlorinated Polyvinyl Chloride (CPVC). Usually, the manufacturing of CPVC involves a free radical chlorination process. At the post-production level, decomposed Chlorine gas comes in contact with PVC. A part of Hydrogen in regular polyvinyl gets replaced with free-radical chlorine in the decomposed gas. Modern innovations in manufacturing processes allow exact chlorination reactions to ensure precisely controlled molecular changes.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Chlorination of regular PVC allows a high degree of temperature resistance and flexibility. As a result, CPVC pipes can continuously withstand both heat and cold without compromising material characteristics.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">CPVC offers all the benefits of PVC along with better tensile strength and temperature limits; it makes CPVC easy to work with for machining and welding. Besides, CPVC as a material offers excellent fire properties. CPVC plumbing pipes and fittings (like PVC) do not catch fire and are self-extinguishing in residential and industrial environments.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="mt-5 mb-4"><strong>Advantages: CPVC pipes for plumbing water supplies lines</strong></h5>
<p><strong>It is stronger.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">CPVC pipes are flexible and stronger than other alternatives, making them an excellent option for applications requiring an extremely durable plumbing system. You do not have to worry about these pipes being damaged by harsh weather conditions or being too exposed to the elements. CPVC also does not corrode. It means that you will not have to worry about cleaning or replacing them for a very long time-one of the top reasons people prefer using CPVC pipes for plumbing residential water supply lines.</p>
<p><strong>It is environment-friendly.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like any thermoplastics, CPVC pipes are environment friendly as they do not require disposal at a landfill. We can recycle them multiple times. Besides, recycling PVC and CPVC are less energy-intensive. Due to its very long lifespan, CPVC pipes do not require regular replacements reducing overall material usage.</p>
<p><strong>It is easy to use.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">CPVC pipes are flexible, strong and durable. As a result, CPVC pipes for plumbing are suitable for use in locations that experience extreme weather conditionsâ€“high heat or extreme cold. The pipes will be able to handle these conditions without being damaged or suffering cracks. The flexibility of CPVC plumbing items allows bending and twisting them without causing physical damage.</p>
<p><strong>It is essential for water safety.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">CPVC pipes are used in domestic, commercial plumbing, irrigation and hydroponic systems. CPVC pipes are especially suitable for applications requiring top-quality water safety. As a material, CPVC is not only resistant to temperature fluctuation but also maintains its resistance to chemicals and electrochemical reactions. The best CPVC pipe for plumbing features smooth inner surfaces preventing deposition, bio growth and need for regular cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>It is a value for money investment.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Money spent on constructing plumbing systems is an investment for home plumbing or non-residential applications. So, you should be conscious while choosing pipes and fittings; CPVC pipes are an excellent choice for longevity, installation ease and operational reliability. Using the best CPVC pipe for plumbing allows you to save much money.</p>
<h5 class="mt-5 mb-4"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Pipe couplings or couplers are very common fittings in any plumbing applications, be it residential, irrigational or industrial. CPVC being a popular choice of piping material in residential and industrial water supply, couplings made of CPVC are regular use fittings. You can find too many non-branded, generic CPVC couplings of different types, sizes, material quality and finishes in any plumbing hardware store. However, they neither promise functional longevity nor operational reliability. Can you compromise with your CPVC water supply plumbing system by choosing an unqualified pipe coupling? CPVC couplings of sub-standard quality can seriously compromise the functionality of any well-designed and perfectly installed plumbing setup. Ask professional plumbers and existing owners. They only trust reputable brands (like Ori-Plast) for top-grade CPVC pipes and fittings.</p>
<h5 class="mt-5 mb-4"><strong>Advantages of top-grade CPVC couplings</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Couplers are usually inexpensive fittings used to join pipes or pipe fittings; they can also serve the purpose of reducers for joining smaller diameter pipes to bigger ones. Generally, FIVE types of CPVC couplings you will regularly find in stores. They are,</p>
<ul>
<li>Full coupling &#8211; connecting small-bore pipes.</li>
<li>Half coupling &#8211; connecting half-size small-bore pipes.</li>
<li>Reducing coupling &#8211; connecting smaller diameter to bigger diameter pipes; or the other way round.</li>
<li> Compression coupling &#8211; preventing leakage using rings and compression nuts.</li>
<li>Slip coupling &#8211; Similar to compression couplers.</li>
</ul>
<h5  class="mt-5 mb-4"><strong>Any top-grade CPVC coupling offers extremely useful BENEFITS over their generic counterparts.</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Resist corrosion like CPVC and prevent biocontamination from depositions within the piping system.</li>
<li>Availability in different sizes, starting from half to full-size couplers for installing a wide range of pipes and fittings.</li>
<li>CPVC-grade ease of installation without requiring specialised skills and tools.</li>
<li>Lightweight and do not put stress on the overall piping structure.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="mt-5 mb-4"><strong>Final verdict</strong></h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is value for money to choose the best quality CPVC couplers and PVC to CPVC coupling fittings. Couplers may look ubiquitous and straightforward. But any compromise in its quality can jeopardise the longevity of any piping structure and functioning of the plumbing system. So, choose only competitively priced branded, quality-assured CPVC coupling fittings. Ori-Plast manufactures international standard ASTM D 2846 compliant couplers and other CPVC pipe fittings.
