										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">uPVC and PVC are two types of thermoplastics that are widely used in construction and manufacturing industries. PVC, also known as polyvinyl chloride, is a synthetic plastic polymer that has been in use since the 1920s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is a versatile material that can be used to produce a wide range of products, including pipes, flooring, roofing, cables, and electrical wires.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uPVC, or unplasticized polyvinyl chloride, is a variant of PVC that is made without the addition of plasticizers, making it a more rigid and durable material. It is commonly used in the construction industry for windows, doors, and pipes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the differences between uPVC and PVC is important for anyone involved in the construction and manufacturing industries. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These two materials have distinct properties that make them suitable for different applications. For example, while PVC is more flexible and easy to work with, uPVC is more rigid and has better resistance to weathering and chemicals. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Submersible pumps are the reliable and energy-efficient option for extracting groundwater from deep boreholes for uninterrupted residential, commercial and municipal water supplies. In places with a fluctuating groundwater table depth, multistage submersible pumps fitted to good quality column pipes are essential. Column pipes hold the weight of the pump assembly, high-pressure water flow, thermal shocks and operational stress. Everyone who owns a borewell understands how necessary column pipes are for submersible pumps.</p>
<h6><strong>Essential qualities of a column pipe</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Column pipes fitted to submersible pumps in any borewell must have the following qualities for efficient and value for money groundwater extraction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chemical resistance &#8211; Groundwater can have different minerals and salts that corrode column pipes carrying the water. It affects pipe longevity and operational efficiency. So, column pipe material should be resistant to chemical and electrochemical reactions to prevent chances of corrosion.</li>
<li>Leak-proof threading &#8211; The locking mechanism to join column pipes should be reliable to avoid chances of leakage of fluid or seepage of contaminants from outside. Improper threads designed and manufactured with poor quality materials are often the primary reason behind damage to borewell column pipes.</li>
<li><strong>Durability</strong> &#8211; Extracting groundwater from deep borewells causes considerable stress to pipes, considering the pump’s heat, water pressure and continuous operational shocks. So, column pipes have to be strong and durable for zero-maintenance longevity.</li>
<li><strong>Easy installation</strong> &#8211; Heavyweight column pipes are not easy to transport and install, particularly in remote geographies. It requires a longer time to complete the project and increased labour cost. So, column pipe material should be strong without unnecessarily increasing the tonnage.</li>
<li><strong>Broader applicability</strong> &#8211; Usability of column pipes for a wide range of applications reduces the need for customisation and scalability, cutting down the overall project cost.</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>Why uPVC column pipes for submersible pumps are the best choice?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Unplasticised PVC is a rigid thermoplastic polymer that offers unmatched benefits for manufacturing column pipes. Some of the salient characteristics of UPVC pipes are,</p>
<ul>
<li>High thermal resistance</li>
<li>Anti-corrosive</li>
<li>Inert to chemical and electrochemical reactions</li>
<li>High strength rigidity and</li>
<li>Lightweight</li>
<li>Easy to install</li>
<li>Non-porous with zero chance of brittle</li>
</ul>
<p>The above characteristics of UPVC thermoplastic make it the best fit for high submersible stress column pipes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Borewells are a major source of household potable water in India; after the agricultural revolution, borewell usage has significantly increased for irrigational purposes. Depending on the level of the local aquifer, quality of soil-rock and usage pattern, the functional longevity of a borewell varies. However, UPVC borewell casing pipes have proved the most effective for wells drawing drinking and agricultural water–the better value for your money.</p>
<h6><strong>The Best Casing Pipe For Borewell</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Casing pipes serve specific purposes in borewells, and they are an essential investment. There have been many technical studies, and all of them indicate that the material for borewell casing pipes must have specific characteristics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-porous, reliable stiffness</li>
<li>High hydrostatic collapse pressure</li>
<li>Zero toxicity</li>
<li>Minimal electro-conductive</li>
<li>Minimal chemical reaction</li>
<li>Minimal chances of microbial growth</li>
<li>Easy to handle and transport</li>
<li>High zero-maintenance functional life</li>
</ul>
<p>According to industry reports and customer satisfaction reviews, UPVC or Unplasticized PVC pipes meet the complete checklist.</p>
<h5><strong>Why UPVC pipes are the best casing pipe for borewells?</strong></h5>
<p></br></p>
<h6><strong>UPVC pipes are durable and long-lasting.</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>UPVC pipes use unplasticised polyvinyl (PVC), making them particularly stiff and long-lasting even under consistent stress and pressure. Extremely high hydrostatic collapse pressure makes UPVC suitable for borewell casing pipes across varieties of soil-rock formations and water pressure. UPVC pipes last long, so you won&#8217;t have to worry about replacing them anytime soon. Quality UPVC pipes can often have more than 100 years of service life.</p>
<h6><strong>UPVC is leak-proof as a material.</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Water is essential for human survival and gets contaminated easily if not taken care of properly. Contamination occurs when sub-surface water enters the borewell and affects the quality of the water. UPVC is non-porous. So, using UPVC pipes is a great way to keep your borewell clean by preventing any contamination from occurring. If you want your borewell to be in good shape for a long time, then you should invest in some durable and long-lasting UPVC pipes!.</p>
<h6><strong>UPVC pipes are resistant to chemical and electrochemical reactions.</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges of casing pipes for borewells is the chemical composition of rock-soil and consistent contact with groundwater. Minerals in the soil-rock often react with casing materials in the presence of oxidisers like water and cause corrosion. UPVC is resistant to corrosion as it is not susceptible to chemical and electrochemical reactions. So, you can rest assured in all types of soil-rock conditions and enjoy safe water for drinking and irrigational usages.</p>
<h6><strong>UPVC pipes are cost-effective</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Although you can buy cheap casing pipes for your borewell, those will not be as durable as well-built quality UPVC pipes. It&#8217;s essential to invest in a long-lasting product that will help provide water for your household and farming usages. Despite high stiffness and material strength, UPVC is lightweight. It makes UPVC pipes easy to transport, handle and install, saving time, effort and money. Installation is quick and easy.</p>
<h6><strong>Finally</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Casing pipe in borewell is an essential component and involves a significant investment. So, it is wise to choose only the quality UPVC pipes from reputed and branded PVC pipes manufacturers. You can always consult with experts. Ori-Plast, a reputable brand of borewell casing pipe manufacturers in India, offers unbiased expert consultation for all your borewell related queries. Call Ori-Plast today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a homeowner, you always have a lot of responsibilities, and it is not easy to take equal care of them every time. Take the example of shopping for PVC and UPVC pipes. Whenever we take up a home plumbing project, either a few pieces of pipes, fittings remain unutilised, or we need to make a quick visit to the hardware shops to buy a few missing pieces in the middle of the work. And all those times, we think the money we could have saved if we had measured the necessary pipes and fittings correctly.</p>
<p>But with so many different plumbing options out there, it can be hard to figure out the type and sizes of PVC plumbing pipes and fittings to buy for your needs. The common mistakes we observe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking incorrect measurements.</li>
<li>Indecision regarding choosing the suitable piping materials.</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>Importance of Right Measurement Before You Go for Pipe Shopping</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Professional plumbers can listen to our requirements, provide ideas on the proper plumbing design, advise on choosing the right type of pipes and carry out the fitting to ensure that your home’s plumbing system is in good condition. However, it is our (the homeowners) personal responsibility to take the final decision after considering all the available alternatives. No one can do it for us.</p>
<p><strong>First of all</strong>,getting the correct measurement before you go PVC pipe shopping is critical to your home plumbing project, irrespective of you do it yourself or hire a professional plumber. You don&#8217;t want to get home and find out that the pipe is too short or long.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>,the appropriate measurement of diameters and lengths of PVC and UPVC pipes and connectors help to plan the plumbing work better. You get the chance to iron out design flaws ahead of spending your money and prepare your plumbing budget correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>,the correct measurement of PVC and UPVC pipes and fittings helps negotiate better deals with PVC and UPVC suppliers. You can save a lot on transportation costs. The top PVC and UPVC pipes manufacturers sell plumbing solutions in all possible standard sizes and deliver non-standard sizes for customised orders. So, even if your project is smaller in scope, the right measurement of pipes and connectors can save future hassles.</p>
<h6><strong>Understanding the Right Measurement of PVC &amp; UPVC Pipes</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>It might seem easy to measure the length of pipes required for any new home plumbing projects–just line up the measuring gauge and take the note! It is not. The correct size of pipes you need for any plumbing project depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Layout plan of the plumbing line</li>
<li>Angles and bends along the line</li>
<li>Flatness (are there any arches?) of the wall along which you will lay the pipes.</li>
<li>Right combinations of pipes of different lengths.</li>
<li>For example, standard uPVC pipes manufacturers, like Ori-Plast, offer blue and white UPVC pipes in lengths of 3, 5 and 6 meters.<br />
The best quality, cost-effective plumbing work depends on the correct combination of standard pieces.</li>
<li>The proper measurement of plumbing lines also helps use the correct pipe connectors. The suitable connectors are essential to ensure an optimum water flow and maintenance-free longevity of the plumbing system.</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>Tips: Choosing Correct Piping Materials </strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Expert plumbers prefer UPVC pipes and connectors for residential water supply and sewage line plumbing projects. The benefits of UPVC pipes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unplasticised PVC or UPVC is less porous, reducing the maintenance requirements.</li>
<li>Top uPVC pipes manufacturers, like Ori-Plast, use lead-free material for carrying water safe for human usage, even in the health<br />
and hospitality business.</li>
<li>The minimal chance of sedimentation ensures zero reduction in the cross-sectional area in uPVC plumbing pipes.</li>
<li>The solid and durable uPVC allows the construction of all-purpose pipes and connectors.</li>
<li>Tasteless and odourless uPVC is suitable for carrying any type of fluid.</li>
<li>Highly economic uPVC reduces the cost of ownership for projects of any size.</li>
<li>All-weather UV-resistant uPVC product lineups are suitable for outdoor plumbing exposed to harsh sunlight.</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>Finally</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Choosing the suitable pipes and connectors for your project may seem like a simple task at first, but it’s easy to get overwhelmed by all of the options and design complications. Do not worry! Follow our simple guidelines. Take extra care to measure your proposed plumbing lines rightly. It will save you time, money and future supply disruptions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6><strong>Top advantages of industrial uses of UPVC pipes: views from experts</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Industrial plumbing is a different ball game. Every project differs in terms of scope and requirements. The margin of error is negligible if not zero. You always work under tremendous pressure to deliver mission-critical plumbing systems that survive stress and perform without causing disruptions or frequent downtimes. Industrial plumbing designers always prefer using UPVC pipes and fittings, from carrying water to removing industrial effluents.</p>
<p>From our interaction with engineers managing industrial constructions, we have shortlisted the top advantages of UPVC pipes for industrial uses.</p>
<h6><strong>What are UPVC pipes? </strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Unplasticised polyvinyl chloride or uPVC is a rigid polymer, best suitable for manufacturing sturdy plumbing pipes and fittings. Unlike regular PVC, unplasticised PVC does not contain BPA and phthalates, making them extra tough. That’s the reason uPVC is popularly also known as rigid plastic. These pipes are suitable for a wide variety of industrial uses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Factories, farmlands or residential houses &#8211; drain pipes are everywhere. They are essential for any human habitation but get the least of our attention. We only start caring about drainage when we are waterlogged. It should not happen. The modern drainage system has improved a lot, starting from the design to the choice of piping materials.</p>
<p>This article discusses how PVC drain pipes can be the best choice for your drainage system.</p>
<h6><strong>The common uses of drain pipes</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The primary use of any drainage pipe is to remove water from one place to another. It can be rainwater, industrial effluents, residual water from irrigated lands or simple wastewater from our houses. Depending on the type of drainage system, the requirement of drain pipes vary. Some of the standard drainage systems are,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surface Drainage </strong>&#8211; it involves the removal of surface water utilising the natural slope of the land.</li>
<li><strong>Subsurface Drainage </strong>&#8211; It is the removal of excess water infiltrated into the soil beyond the capillary capacity of the earth.</li>
<li><strong>Slope Drainage</strong> &#8211; This system helps prevent soil erosion and collapse of the land’s natural slope, especially in the hill region.</li>
<li><strong>Downspout and Gutter </strong>&#8211; These are primarily drainage systems to carry rainwater.</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>Advantages of PVC drain pipes </strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Almost every drainage system today use PVC drain pipes and PVC drain fittings for their apparent benefits. Metal pipes have become mostly obsolete. And there are too many reasons behind the widespread popularity of PVC drainage pipes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental benefits</strong> &#8211; PVC is low on carbon content, and it requires less energy to manufacture. Besides, it is lightweight compared to drainage pipes made of alternative materials. So, you can save money on transportation costs.</li>
<li><strong>Chemical resistance</strong> &#8211; Wasterwater, especially industrial effluents, can contain corrosive chemicals. Drain pipes need to be resistant to chemical reactions. PVC serves the purpose perfectly well.</li>
<li><strong>No rust and metal-like corrosion </strong>&#8211; Despite protective coating, metal pipes corrode after a time. It does not happen with PVC drain pipes and fittings.</li>
<li><strong>Strong and durable</strong> &#8211; Despite being a lightweight material, PVC is as strong and durable as metal pipes. PVC pipes do not easily succumb to shocks, pressure and survive a more comprehensive temperature range.</li>
<li><strong>Low-maintenance</strong> &#8211; Low maintenance is essential for any drainage system to make it sustainable over the long run. PVC drain pipes do not require regular upkeeping.</li>
</ul>
