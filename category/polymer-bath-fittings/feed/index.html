										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6><strong>Importance of Bathroom Fittings Selection for Your Luxury Modular Bathroom Design </strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>A few years back, I was staying in an apartment in New Delhi, a posh locality, upmarket residential complex. I liked it for the proximity to my workplace and the lovely green ambience. But the only eyesore was its bathrooms. The owner never cared to design them correctly or accessorise them with modern luxury bathroom fittings, which messed up the whole living experience.</p>
<h6><strong>Luxury of bathrooms </strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Luxury modular bathrooms are becoming an integral part of our lifestyle. Think about those old-fashioned, dimly-lit, claustrophobic, closet-sized spaces we were used to calling toilets. Modern apartments and living quarters accommodate designing, building luxury bathrooms with all modern amenities. You can lay tiles, use bright lighting fixtures, use expensive mirrors, shower booths, bathtubs and other things. However, the quality of your bath fittings can make or break your private space. Do you want to know why choosing luxury bathroom fitting is essential? How can you choose the right quality luxury bath fittings?</p>
<h6><strong>Luxury bath fittings &#8211; is it a waste of money? </strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Polymer bathroom fittings are essential for functional as well as aesthetic reasons in any luxury modular bathroom. Let me explain some of the salient benefits of luxury bath fittings made of PTMT SYMET.</p>
<h6><strong>Corrosion proof </strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Corrosion is a significant problem we face in our domestic water supplies—the dissolved chemicals and salts in water cause depositions in bathroom fittings and a substantial amount of corrosion. Besides, freshwater enables faster oxidation of iron or any other metal. It reduces pipes’ durability. So, it is beneficial to use non-metal bathroom fittings that are naturally resistant to corrosion. PTMT SYMET pillar cock, bibcock, stop cock, long neck and other luxury bath fittings are ideal fit-n-forget products.</p>
<h6><strong>Colourful and modern in design </strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Gone are the days when bathrooms were one of the most dull-coloured and dimly-lit places in a house. Today people decorate bathrooms in shades matching with other parts of their homes. So, people are expecting bath fittings in different shades and designs. Polymer luxury bath fittings offer sleek design, finish and more comprehensive colour options compared to metal alternatives.</p>
<h6><strong>Leak-proof, drip-proof &amp; durable</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Would you like water dripping and leaking from bath fittings in a well-decorated luxury modular bathroom? Of course, not! It is not only a nagging sight but also a safety concern. Polymer, PTMT SYMET bath fittings are corrosion resistant. Polymer connectors enforced with suitable polymer cement make your bathroom drip-proof and leak-proof, improving the overall usability of the bathroom.</p>
<h6><strong>Quality with Affordability</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Polymer luxury bath fittings are a lot more affordable compared to metal alternatives of similar quality. It means PTMT and other polymer luxury bathroom fittings score high on both the grounds &#8211; quality and value for money. It’s the best deal.</p>
<p>So whether you are renovating your home or moving into a new place, always make sure you invest in the right quality luxury bathroom fittings to make your ‘private’ private space comfortable and lavish. You will never regret it. Ori-Plast is a top Indian brand offering made-in-India new-age polymer luxury bath fittings. Check Ori-Plast’s range of PTMT SYMET bath fittings products. They are exotic, elegant and made of the best-in-class material quality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you are upgrading your plumbing system or planning the next plumbing project, it’s important to choose the right type of pipe for the job. It is becoming more common to replace metal water pipes by polymer pipes due to the many advantages of plastic over metal. Let us find out what makes Polymer pipes, more commonly known as PVC pipes,stronger and more popular than metal pipes.</p>
<p><a href="https://oriplast.com/polymer-bath-fittings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polymer pipes</a> are most commonly made of Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which is a combination of plastic and vinyl. There are also CPVC (chlorinatedpolyvinyl chloride) piping, PERT (polyethylene-raised temperature) and others to choose from. The safety, durability, cost efficiency and recyclability of polymer piping have made it a preferred choice for various piping applications ranging from drinking water transportation, to drainage systems to fire sprinkler solutions.</p>
<h6><strong>Advantages of Using Plastic Pipes over Metals Pipes</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The word “plastic” mean pliable, or something that can be easily shaped. This property of plastics and numerous other features make it a valuable raw material for the piping industry.</p>
<h6><strong>Safety</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Polymer pipes are a safe choice for transporting clean, healthy drinking water. These pipes offer high degree of inertness and resistance to corrosion, which makes them free from bio-film contamination that leads to bacterial growth.</p>
<p>Besides, there are risks like accidents and injuries involved in manufacturing metal parts. Plastic, being comparatively softer and smoother, is safer and easily moldable.</p>
<h6><strong>Durability</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The expected lifespan of an underground polymer pipe can extend over 100 years. One of the main reasons for such longer life is the ability of plastics to withstand physical, chemical, environmental and weather attacks. Metals, on the other hand, are highly prone to chemical and weather attacks –one of the key reasons why plastic pipes are preferred over metal pipes.</p>
<h6><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>PVC pipes are the most cost effective choices compared to other piping materials. The cost to purchase, install, maintain and operate is significantly lower than metals. Home owners and industries can safely choose plastic pipes for their piping needs.</p>
<h6><strong>Lightweight</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Plastic pipes are much more light weight than their metal counterparts, weighing ten times less than steel. Reducing part weight is one the major concerns of any industry. Replacing heavy metal pipes can be a major, expensive operation.</p>
<h6><strong>Environment Friendly</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Since polymer is a low carbon plastic, PVC have definite environmental advantages over other materials. Polymer pipes are more efficient to manufacture in terms of energy consumption, and are non toxic, which helps the environment.</p>
<p>Metal pipes are susceptible to leakage, which leads to water loss and ultimately higher water bills. Plastic water pipes can help conserve water through reduced leakage.</p>
<h6><strong>Recyclability</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>The biggest advantage of plastic over metals is that plastic can be recycled. Polymer pipes can be melted and reused several times, while metal pipes once damaged must be discarded and replaced.</p>
<h6><strong>Faster Manufacturing</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Plastics can be easily manufactured in comparison to metals. Shorter production cycle contributes to higher cost efficiency.</p>
