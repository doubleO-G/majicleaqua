										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Have you ever wondered where the water in your taps and wells comes from? In many places, especially in rural areas, it&#8217;s the borewell system that serves as a lifeline, providing access to groundwater. In this article, we&#8217;ll dive deep into what a borewell system is and how it works in simple terms, so you can understand this vital source of water supply.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What is a Borewell System?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A borewell system is essentially a narrow, deep hole drilled into the Earth&#8217;s surface to access groundwater. It&#8217;s like a straw that reaches down to the water hidden beneath the ground. The term &#8216;<a href="https://oriplast.com/borewell/">borewell</a>&#8216; comes from &#8216;bore,&#8217; meaning to drill or dig, and &#8216;well,&#8217; indicating a source of water.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Components of a Borewell Systems</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Borehole:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the actual hole drilled into the ground. It can be quite deep, depending on the water source&#8217;s depth. Boreholes are typically made using heavy machinery designed for drilling into the Earth&#8217;s crust.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Casing Pipe:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To keep the borehole from collapsing, a <a href="https://oriplast.com/pvc-pipes/borewell-casing/">casing pipe</a> is inserted into the hole. It&#8217;s usually made of steel or PVC and provides structural support to the borewell.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Screen Pipe:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below the casing pipe, a screen pipe is installed. This pipe has tiny holes that allow water to enter while preventing sand and debris from getting in.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Pump:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the bottom of the <a href="https://oriplast.com/borewell/">borewell</a>, there&#8217;s a submersible pump that draws water from the ground and sends it up to the surface. It&#8217;s like a magic wand that brings water to your home.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">How Does a Borewell System Work?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The concept behind a borewell system is simple. When the <a href="https://oriplast.com/upvc-column-pipes-for-submersible-pumps/">submersible pump</a> is turned on, it creates a vacuum that sucks water up from the ground through the screen pipe. This water is then pushed up through the casing pipe and reaches your taps and storage tanks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Borewell systems</strong> are a crucial source of water in many areas, especially where surface water sources like rivers and lakes might not be readily available. They provide a reliable source of clean water for drinking, irrigation, and other everyday needs.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Maintenance and Care</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like any other system, borewells require proper maintenance. Over time, the screen pipe can become clogged with silt or other debris, reducing the flow of water. Regular cleaning and periodic inspections are necessary to keep your borewell functioning effectively.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In essence, a <strong>borewell system</strong> is like a straw that reaches deep into the Earth to bring up the precious gift of groundwater. It&#8217;s a lifeline for many communities, ensuring a consistent supply of clean water for their daily needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Understanding the basics of how borewells work can help us appreciate this vital resource even more. So, the next time you turn on the tap, you&#8217;ll know that it&#8217;s the borewell system that&#8217;s bringing that cool, refreshing water into your life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How would you like to spend your borewell drilling budget? Would you settle for a messy fabrication now and keep wasting money, time and labour later on maintenance, all the time? We hope not. A borewell should be like an investment that, once made, keeps giving dividends without causing regular harassment.</p>
<p>So, let us begin by discussing the casing pipes.</p>
<h6><strong>Why does the quality of borewell casing pipe matter?</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Casing pipe in borewell is a significant structural component affecting water quality, longevity, and hitchless functionality. The importance of a good casing pipe for a borewell can never be overestimated. A good quality casing pipe and column pipe is indispensable for all the following reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Preventing a borehole from caving in due to collapse pressure.</li>
<li>Stopping fine sand particles from entering and clogging a borehole.</li>
<li>Maintaining water safety by preventing contaminants from seepages.</li>
<li>Ensuring maintenance-free longevity.</li>
</ul>
<h6><strong>Factors you should remember while choosing borewell casing pipes.</strong></h6>
<p></br></p>
<p>Borewell casing pipes can be made of different materials like mild steel, stainless steel, PVC, uPVC. Before choosing anyone, you should know the essential characteristics that a casing pipe should have to keep your borewell in perfect shape over a long period.</br><br />
<strong>Collapse pressure</strong> &#8211; It measures the pressure a pipe or tube receives from outside. When the outside pressure increases from a pipe’s rated collapse pressure, the pipe collapses. A borewell casing pipe receives constant pressure from surrounding soil and rock formation. So, it should have a high rated collapse pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Non-conductive to electricity</strong> &#8211; The nature of soil differs from acidic to alkaline and from dry to wet. Electrically conductive piping materials are always vulnerable to electrochemical reactions. It rodes a pipe’s structural strength and longevity. So, you need to choose chemically non-reactive piping materials like uPVC. Otherwise, you need to have pipes with a protective coating on the outer layer.</p>
<p><strong>Resistant to corrosion, non-toxic</strong> &#8211; It is easy to understand that non-corrosive, non-toxic casing pipes are always the best choice for your borewell and the water you pump out from it.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of transportation and installation</strong> &#8211; Ease of installation is one of the most important factors because it can make or break any borewell drilling project. Casing pipes requiring a high level of installation skill can increase unnecessary cost and complexity. Besides, lightweight pipes are easier to transport and offer a lot of cost-saving.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of maintenance</strong> &#8211; We started this article by talking about the burden of regular maintenance. Any casing pipe for a borewell that requires routine maintenance can be difficult to upkeep. It increases downtime and adds up cost.</p>
